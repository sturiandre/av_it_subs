00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:11,600
## every year every cow and every dairy farm is 
## raped a long steel device shoving their vaginas  




275
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,120
## to inject them with bull semen or sometimes 
## they use a bare hand this forces the milk flow  




276
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,760
## and after she gives birth babies are stolen and 
## let me tell you something the worst scream i have  




277
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,640
## ever heard and i've heard them all firsthand 
## when i started finding out about this stuff  




278
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,680
## a little over 15 years ago i was like everybody 
## else i didn't believe it was that bad i thought  




279
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,520
## everybody was exaggerating but unlike everybody 
## else who just blows it aside brushes it off  




280
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,200
## i actually went to see what was going on i 
## spent six weeks at thorne apple valley page  




281
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,400
## slaughterhouse in detroit in 1993. i broke into 
## animal research laboratories i broke into fur  




282
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,280
## farms i went behind the scenes of every circus 
## and every rodeo that ever came through michigan  




283
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,720
## worst scream i've ever heard 
## a mother cow on a dairy farm  




284
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,160
## as she screams and bellows her lungs out day after 
## day for her stolen baby to be given back to her  




285
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,080
## and i can only imagine the same scream every woman 
## in this room would make if somebody held you down  




286
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,760
## after birth and stole your newborn baby from you 
## and why did they take babies away from their mom  




287
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,040
## well the dairy is you can't have little babies 
## sucking up all that milk that was meant for them  




288
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,880
## when they'd rather sell it to you instead 
## every time you have a glass of cow milk  




289
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,480
## some calf is not and mother cows make milk 
## for one reason anyways during q a we're about  




290
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,680
## to have you can ask me whatever you want i'm no 
## politician bring up anything if you went online  




291
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,560
## before i got here saw my radical essays that 
## got me kicked out of countries bring them up  




292
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,080
## there is one question i will not entertain them 
## you cannot ask me why cows make milk thus if  




293
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,920
## it's good for us shouldn't we be feeding it 
## to our kids gary shouldn't we be having it  




294
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,720
## nature took care of this one at the beginning of 
## time cows make milk for their babies and for their  




295
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,840
## babies alone case is closed forever permanently 
## no debate no discussion they don't make milk for  




296
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,280
## baby elephants baby orangutans baby headshots 
## baby rabbits baby rats baby humans adolescent  




297
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,000
## humans or adult humans this body of ours has 
## absolutely no need for cow milk like it has  




298
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,800
## absolutely no need for giraffe milk and zebra milk 
## and rhinoceros milk hippopotamus milk camel milk  




299
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,280
## deer milk antelope milk horse milk pig milk dog 
## milk or cat milk the only milk that we ever need  




300
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,760
## is our own mother's breast milk when we're born 
## that's it and when we're done weaning we never  




301
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:00,240
## need one drop of milk ever again no species on 
## this planet needs milk after they're done weaning  




302
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,320
## but if you want to include some kind of milk in 
## your diet like i do let me reiterate the good news  




303
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,640
## soy milk rice milk almond milk hemp 
## milk coconut milk oat milk hazelnut milk  




304
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,160
## you don't give up anything you 
## got the vegan version of stuff  




305
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,720
## or eat things that are truly natural like fruits 
## and vegetables beans and lentils and seeds




306
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,880
## so the new number one excuse to eat animals is 
## no longer god says it's okay that's number two  




307
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,760
## now it's now the circle of life so we're gonna 
## look at the circle of life from the victim's  




308
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,920
## point of view which nobody ever does as 
## you're about to see this zebra does not  




309
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,120
## want to be a victim to a lion any more than 
## a cow or a chicken wants to be your victim




310
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
## about to see an alligator trying 
## to take down a baby impala  




311
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,400
## and there's an angry vegan looking on i 
## empathize he's going to get involved and stop him




312
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,800
## he's about to give mouth to 
## mouth and he never took the  




313
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,720
## saturday morning cpr class at the local 
## community college to figure out how to do that  




314
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,160
## they're much brighter than we give him credit for 
## but for the record not all animals are brilliant  




315
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,520
## some are stupid just like human beings some 
## are bright some are stupid they're just like us




316
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,640
## if a bunch of violent thugs kidnapped your baby  




317
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,360
## threaten and kill him and 
## you are out muscled and man




318
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
## you might go get some backup too




319
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,840
## by the way the only bright 
## lion in this whole pride
