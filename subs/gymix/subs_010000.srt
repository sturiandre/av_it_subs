458
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,960
## but we're a bunch of violent 
## monkeys what makes you think we care




459
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,880
## to this day that statement still breaks 
## my heart but i refuse to believe that  




460
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:25,600
## no one cares because the only problem 
## is you've been programmed not to care  




461
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:33,920
## brainwashed to be a good little lifelong consumer 
## of animal body parts same thing happened to me for  




462
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:43,840
## the first part of my life for 25 years but if you 
## just put your defenses down i can un-brainwash and  




463
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,840
## deprogram you for free no gimmicks no books 
## to buy no email list to join i just want to  




464
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,840
## put you back in touch with your conscience again 
## the conscience that you had when you were young  




465
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:05,200
## innocent and uncorrupted by society's lies it 
## can't be that difficult to understand that each  




466
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:11,840
## animal values his or her life as much as you 
## value yours you might not care about cows and  




467
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,160
## pigs and chickens and fish but when your thoughts 
## are prejudicial who the hell cares what you think  




468
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:27,280
## believe whatever you want to believe but you 
## have no right to act out your violent desires and  




469
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,440
## listen if you want to sit around all day smoking 
## weed eating oreo cookies sipping on a two liter  




470
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:41,600
## of mountain dew be my guest because ain't nothing 
## wrong with smoking some kush and oreos and soda  




471
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:47,520
## happen to be vegan they're sugar and chemicals 
## pure garbage but if you want to harm yourself  




472
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:54,240
## you have every right to do so i am not the health 
## police but you have no right to harm somebody else  




473
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:01,440
## in the process of harming yourself so i am the 
## ethics police and vegans will defend animals from  




474
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,360
## you until this massacre stops you don't really 
## think the entire animal kingdom worships us  




475
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:16,160
## thinks we're special believes that we are the 
## image of god we're like a colombian drug cartel  




476
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:23,280
## we're a bunch of bullies criminals and killers 
## a symbiotic relationship between humans and  




477
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,320
## animals is not happening when all we do is 
## take and take and take and take a little more  




478
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:37,840
## we steal their milk their eggs their honey 
## their skin their flesh their lives symbiotic  




479
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,680
## relationships are supposed to benefit each 
## party when there's only one beneficiary  




480
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:50,560
## it's called slavery it's time to become the 
## rational beings that we always claim to be  




481
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,040
## and speaking of becoming rational got to say 
## something to my religious friends out there today  




482
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:05,440
## because the oldest excuse in the book god says 
## it's okay is the dumbest [ __ ] i've ever heard  




483
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:13,040
## in my life to harm somebody else because if you 
## believe that god gave us the architectural plans  




484
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,960
## to construct a house of slaughter so we can 
## cut the heads off of his terrified animals  




485
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,560
## that he doesn't mind when we steal newborn 
## babies from their mothers or cut their horns  




486
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:30,720
## and beaks and tails and teeth off while they're 
## fully conscious then what does the devil do




487
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,840
## what could a cow a pig a chicken or turkey ever do  




488
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,840
## to deserve the wrath of god 
## himself or eternal damnation




489
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,760
## and for the atheists and the agnostics in the 
## crowd you ain't off the hook either where's that  




490
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,440
## logical lifestyle you're always preaching about 
## because if you discriminate against animals and  




491
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,960
## eat meat cheese milk eggs and honey then you are 
## no different than all the religious people that  




492
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:14,160
## you condemn and for the record i do not condemn 
## god i condemn violent rituals and bloodthirsty  




493
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,080
## habits and traditions in god's name because i've 
## noticed something quite disturbing about all  




494
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:27,760
## religious people all over this planet they never 
## ever worship anything that god actually created  




495
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:38,000
## the only worship things that we created in god's 
## name bibles crosses churches synagogues korans  




496
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,400
## stars of david the wailing wall i 
## can assure you that god is completely  




497
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:49,680
## unimpressed with our creations and with us as long 
## as we act like barbarians living in peace though  




498
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,720
## i think you'd be pretty impressed with that you 
## can't possibly believe there are slaughter houses  




499
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,120
## in heaven or that violence against animals was 
## allowed in the garden of eden and those are god's
