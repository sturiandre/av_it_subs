01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:09,120
## two most perfect places now i want to destroy 
## some other lies you've heard way too much about  




501
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:15,520
## first people often ask me why we can't eat eggs 
## from some hens living in our backyard or from a  




502
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:24,560
## free range farm their bodies do not belong to us 
## commodification is the crime as much as cruelty is  




503
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,960
## and i've noticed that nobody ever wants to adopt 
## old hens to live in their backyard the ones who  




504
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,240
## have stopped laying eggs they only want the 
## young ones who are still freshly modified  




505
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:45,200
## genetically to lay 300 eggs every year 
## instead of their normal 17 eggs every year  




506
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,080
## pens just like sheep in the 
## wool industry always get killed  




507
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:56,960
## when they stop producing things that we want them 
## to produce and finally let's talk about the plants  




508
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:04,080
## and whether they suffer because the latest idiocy 
## and lunacy being tossed my way the last couple  




509
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,280
## of years has been hey man carrots suffer and 
## die just like cows do so what's the difference




510
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,640
## okay in case you were unaware of this difference 
## you have to have a functioning central nervous  




511
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:23,360
## system connected to a brain in order to suffer and 
## this is not up for debate which is why people in  




512
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:32,720
## the hospital who are brain dead but still alive 
## but can't feel anything are cold how about that  




513
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,080
## little truth in science for a change yeah we don't 
## call these people fish we don't call them chickens  




514
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:47,120
## and turkeys and cows and pigs we call them 
## vegetables but even if someone somehow proved  




515
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:53,680
## that in sentient life forms like plants were 
## capable of suffering we're causing more harm  




516
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,680
## to the planet by harvesting all the plants 
## and feeding all those plants to the animals  




517
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,720
## and killing all the animals to get 
## the nutrients they got from the plants  




518
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:07,120
## which were all the nutrients that we needed to 
## begin with with all the crop land in america alone  




519
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:14,880
## america could be feeding 10 billion people again 
## there's only and a half billion on the planet  




520
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,480
## which means less land would be used less plants 
## would be harvested less violence committed  




521
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,040
## if we ate plants directly and if plants really 
## can't suffer how can firefighters never rescue  




522
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:33,120
## them and don't say it's discriminatory 
## because animals are the most discriminated  




523
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,080
## species on this planet but there's still a 
## plan in place to save them during a fight  




524
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,320
## humans get safe first but if it's safe to do 
## so even if it's unsafe to do so they'll go  




525
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:51,920
## back inside and save the animals but even if it 
## were safe to do so again no fire fighter in the  




526
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,280
## history of the world has ever gone back in a 
## third time to save the chrysanthemums hey bob  




527
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,320
## quick you saved the basil plant from the kitchen 
## i'll get the road identity from the second floor  




528
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:09,840
## do you think that if i gain lectures about cruelty 
## to vegetables especially root vegetables like yams  




529
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,320
## called my speech the silence of the yams




530
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,880
## because everybody knows that yams scream 
## for about 30 to 45 seconds after you gank  




531
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:26,800
## them out of the ground before they die that 
## i would have been invited into 180 schools  




532
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:35,840
## to give 2600 lectures to 60 000 students in 30 
## different states and i was just thinking about  




533
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,680
## this the other day but what do we say about fruits 
## and vegetables when they get old they're ripe  




534
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:53,760
## ready to eat or rot and what do we say 
## about animals when they get old they're old  




535
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,720
## because animals are alive in 
## the exact same way that we are  




536
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:12,640
## and plants are food so can we please stop making 
## up idiotic excuses to torture and kill the animals  




537
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,840
## and make up an excuse to care about them instead 
## to become vegan actually live by the golden rule  




538
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,960
## instead of just paying lip service to it do 
## unto others as you would have others do unto you




539
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:36,720
## good evening my name is gary yourofsky in 1996 
## i founded adapt which became michigan's most  




540

## in 2002 i became the official orator of peta  




541

## people for the ethical treatment of animals 
## because of my michigan ties many midwestern  




542
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,840
## law enforcement agencies government officials 
## media people and politicians know me as the  




543
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:59,680
## most outspoken and radical activist not only in 
## the state of michigan but in the entire midwest
