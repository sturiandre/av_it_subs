441
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,840
## hello




442
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,840
## oh




443
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,840
## hey




444
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,840
## um




445
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:11,840
## so




446
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,840
## john never down




447
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,240
## there was nothing wrong with killing 
## animals and eating meat was okay  




448
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,080
## how come mcdonald's and burger king and 
## wendy's never show those images in their tv ads




449
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,760
## are we showing you a happy singing 
## smiling cartoon caricature instead




450
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,200
## people are up in arms right now about all the 
## beheadings taking place in the middle east




451
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,160
## meanwhile 30 million innocent animals 
## every day in america are beheaded  




452
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,440
## and no one says a damn thing about it  




453
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,840
## so i'm a little confused is beheading evil or 
## does it matter who's getting their heads cut off




454
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,480
## i will forever be embarrassed to be a human being  




455
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,480
## to stand upright like that's something 
## to be proud of you got to be kidding me  




456
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,440
## a retired marine in north carolina once 
## heard me lecture at east carolina university  




457
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:03,680
## and he said gary i believe everything 
## you said got no arguments for you at all
