02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:11,280
## it needs from a meat-based diet diseases come 
## and have been proven to come time and time again  




1266
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:16,639
## from meat and dairy and i'm still looking for the 
## first medical report in history that can indict  




1267
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:23,359
## broccoli or bananas or carrots or apples as a 
## cause of illness i want to take a few moments  




1268
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:28,960
## now and destroy this myth about human beings being 
## on top of the food chain because tools and weapons  




1269
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:34,240
## power and intelligence have not magically 
## transformed our physiology and turned us into  




1270
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:41,439
## carnivores or omnivores sharks lions tigers bears 
## wolves hyenas jackals even most dogs could easily  




1271
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:48,080
## kill a human being in fact most herbivores like 
## rhinos elephants hippos horses bulls and gorillas  




1272
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:53,519
## could easily kill a human being if provoked these 
## animals have always been ahead of us on the food  




1273
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:59,040
## chain because killing during a one-on-one 
## confrontation without the use of weapons  




1274
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:04,479
## and the ability to consume bloody raw flesh right 
## from the bone without the side effect of disease  




1275
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:10,720
## have always been the only two true factors in 
## determining placement on the food chain this  




1276
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:16,479
## is why most medical experts will attest to the 
## fact that human beings are completely herbivorous  




1277
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:22,479
## creatures dr william roberts editor-in-chief of 
## the american journal of cardiology states quite  




1278
02:41:22,479 --> 02:41:28,639
## simply human beings are not natural carnivores 
## because when we kill animals to eat them  




1279
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:36,319
## they end up killing us because their flesh was 
## never intended for human beings who are natural  




1280
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:42,000
## herbivores the dairy industry has done a pretty 
## masterful job at convincing most people that cows  




1281
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:47,439
## naturally give milk i really hope you don't 
## believe that i still come across children to this  




1282
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:53,519
## day you know the age-old we've got to milk them 
## and they'll explode female cows are like any other  




1283
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:59,600
## female mammal on this planet they only give milk 
## during and after pregnancy which is why every year  




1284
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:05,200
## like clockwork they are artificially inseminated 
## it keeps their milk flow going and within a few  




1285
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:12,240
## days of giving birth their babies are stolen from 
## them they are breaking up families now they steal  




1286
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:16,880
## their babies from them at birth because from a 
## business standpoint you can't have a whole bunch  




1287
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:22,399
## of little baby cows sucking up all the precious 
## milk they want to sell to us humans where do male  




1288
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:29,279
## babies go on a dairy farm males obviously don't 
## give milk completely useless but unlike the male  




1289
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:35,120
## baby chicks they've discovered a use for them they 
## are shipped off to the veal farm where they're put  




1290
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:40,319
## in tiny little crates and kept in the dark to keep 
## them quiet ropes and chains around their necks to  




1291
02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:46,719
## keep keep them completely immobilized see that 
## is why veal is such a tender meat no movement is  




1292
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:51,760
## ever allowed on behalf of these animals because 
## no muscle development is ever allowed they want  




1293
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:57,520
## these animals to get to a large weight more meat 
## to sell but still retain their infant white flesh  




1294
02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:03,200
## but if you knew all of that about veal and you 
## don't eat it because you feel for little baby boy  




1295
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:08,880
## cows and i mean really who wouldn't if you don't 
## eat veal but you do drink milk and eat cheese  




1296
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:15,839
## eat veal you can eat veal to your heart's content 
## because it doesn't make a bit of difference the  




1297
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:22,080
## veal industry is only in existence because of the 
## dairy industry and once again that's their words  




1298
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:27,359
## not mine and we kind of talked about this already 
## but everyone in this room knows why a cow really  




1299
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:33,839
## makes milk right a mother cow makes milk for her 
## babies so cow's milk is meant for a baby cow just  




1300
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:40,640
## like human milk is meant for a baby human the 
## human body has no more need for cow's milk than  




1301
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:48,080
## we do for dog milk giraffe milk rhinoceros milk 
## zebra milk i promise you there will come a day  




1302
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:56,240
## when our grandchildren will ask us where were you 
## during the animal holocaust and what did you do  




1303
02:43:56,240 --> 02:44:01,599
## to stop these horrifying crimes will you be 
## able to say that you stood up against oppression  




1304
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:05,759
## even when doing so was 
## considered radical or unpopular  




1305
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:13,200
## so please please reevaluate your belief systems 
## ask yourself why is all this violence against  




1306
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:19,279
## animals being permitted for what reasons we 
## hope you'll have the same revelation that we did  




1307
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:23,920
## that non-violence through veganism 
## non-violence through animal liberation  




1308
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:31,840
## is the only ethical and acceptable way to live 
## on this planet thank you very much for listening  




1309
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:40,560
## i just recently read this story about this nazi 
## his name was ernst gerbel he and his men were  




1310
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:47,840
## executing children one day but he didn't like the 
## way his guards were grabbing kids by their hair  




1311
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:55,200
## before they shot him in the back of the head and 
## tossed him in a mass grave he actually ordered his  




1312
02:44:55,200 --> 02:45:03,279
## men to stop grabbing the kids by their hair 
## and i quote kill them in a more decent way
