03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:09,120
## no logical person could choose to continue 
## to eat animal flesh and the things that come  




1607
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:15,279
## out of animals so what is your final goal 
## to to kill the meat industry to kill the  




1608
03:20:16,720 --> 03:20:22,880
## farms i want to destroy all animal exploitative 
## industries they're unjust the animals are not  




1609
03:20:22,880 --> 03:20:27,840
## willing participants in this holocaust what about 
## the people that take place in those uh industries  




1610
03:20:28,479 --> 03:20:36,239
## i read this somewhere that you said that uh a 
## man that hurts an animal uh uh you could kill  




1611
03:20:36,239 --> 03:20:42,559
## him or should die or something like that there's 
## a justification for killing anybody who harms  




1612
03:20:42,560 --> 03:20:49,359
## a human or an animal intentionally again you have 
## to understand nobody's opposed to violence and  




1613
03:20:49,359 --> 03:20:54,799
## i've been asking the audience here every day raise 
## your hand if you're opposed to the allied forces  




1614
03:20:55,359 --> 03:21:02,000
## coming into auschwitz and birkenau and murdering 
## nazis to save jews and nobody raises their hands  




1615
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:07,120
## the problem is nobody thinks animals are 
## important enough to kill for i think the  




1616
03:21:07,120 --> 03:21:12,000
## animals disagree i think the cows and the chickens 
## disagree so if i went into a slaughterhouse i'm  




1617
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:16,960
## the peaceful person if i even if i had guns 
## drawn i don't know what's not about operator  




1618
03:21:16,960 --> 03:21:22,640
## i would say drop your weapons you're done killing 
## you're going to let these cows and these pigs and  




1619
03:21:22,640 --> 03:21:28,319
## these chickens go i'm the one that's justified i'm 
## stopping murder there's a justification there's  




1620
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:34,880
## nobility in killing somebody who has no the allied 
## forces were noble do you think they weren't noble  




1621
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:39,439
## do you think that they should have let nazis 
## kill jesus they did what they should have done  




1622
03:21:39,439 --> 03:21:43,759
## and that's what we need to do as human beings if 
## we claim to be compassionate claim to know right  




1623
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:49,840
## from wrong we have to kill beings who kill evil 
## people but with that saying you give legitimacy to  




1624
03:21:49,840 --> 03:21:56,160
## people who murder other people you know every each 
## um every person could choose his own goal like uh  




1625
03:21:56,160 --> 03:22:01,359
## the person who killed our prime minister igalami 
## he said okay i did it to save the country to save  




1626
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:06,319
## more people getting killed but you know why that 
## was unjust who was he killing the prime minister  




1627
03:22:06,319 --> 03:22:11,279
## no who was the prime minister killing nobody you 
## understand the difference between a murder for no  




1628
03:22:11,279 --> 03:22:16,800
## reason a psychotic murder a psychotic murder that 
## a fundamentalist jew a fundamentalist christian  




1629
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:22,640
## the fundamentalist muslim takes part in and going 
## into a slaughterhouse and saying leave these cows  




1630
03:22:22,640 --> 03:22:30,800
## alone nobody chickens have harmed nobody we are 
## murdering innocent beings so if it ever came down  




1631
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:35,840
## to that but that's not the issue that is not the 
## issue the issue is we just need to change the way  




1632
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:40,720
## we view animals we have to realize humans aren't 
## the only beings on this planet and we're not  




1633
03:22:40,720 --> 03:22:45,439
## more important than animals so why are aren't 
## you allowed in some countries you can't enter  




1634
03:22:45,439 --> 03:22:51,679
## canada uh or the uk i think because we live on 
## a planet that murders animals a speciesistic  




1635
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:57,520
## plant and understand like a racist who thinks that 
## their race is better than another race speciesists  




1636
03:22:57,520 --> 03:23:02,319
## think that the human species is superior to 
## animals and we have the right to harm and kill  




1637
03:23:02,319 --> 03:23:07,920
## any species we choose so why would countries 
## who murder animals want me to come in there  




1638
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:12,160
## and open people's eyes and get people to change 
## were you surprised from your success in israel  




1639
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:18,880
## i've always noticed that over the years if 
## i talk to people who have been oppressed  




1640
03:23:18,880 --> 03:23:23,520
## if i do a classroom full of jewish 
## people if i do a classroom full of women  




1641
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:30,319
## full of hispanics black people people who have 
## been oppressed understand oppression so i'm  




1642
03:23:30,319 --> 03:23:36,080
## not surprised that israel is embracing veganism 
## right now and embracing me we've been oppressed  




1643
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:41,120
## way back into egypt times and to this day still 
## depending on what part of the world you're in  




1644
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:46,880
## so people who have been harmed understand why 
## it's wrong to harm somebody else so you really  




1645
03:23:46,880 --> 03:23:51,840
## think you have a chance i think there's a chance 
## i mean it kind of depends on which day you ask me  




1646
03:23:51,840 --> 03:23:56,239
## you ask me when i'm in israel for the last 10 
## days and people are embracing me i think yeah  




1647
03:23:56,239 --> 03:24:01,599
## i think israel could become the first nation 
## on this planet to abolish concentration camps  




1648
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:06,239
## once and for all you ask me on a bad day when 
## people are screaming and yelling at me wanting  




1649
03:24:06,239 --> 03:24:11,840
## to fight i'll say no i don't think it's possible 
## but keep in mind no injustice can live forever  




1650
03:24:12,399 --> 03:24:18,319
## sadly injustice can live for hundreds or 
## even thousands of years but no lie can last  




1651
03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:23,040
## forever and people are becoming aware and i 
## think animals will obtain their freedom one
