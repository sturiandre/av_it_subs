## holiday so the kid is confused growing up so when  




1505
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:21,200
## we get down to talking about discrimination and 
## why it's wrong where it comes from it all stems  




1506

## from that somebody looks and acts differently 
## than you if you taught a child growing up that hey  




1507
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:32,080
## just because that chicken looks differently than 
## you do that chicken has every right to live that  




1508
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:37,040
## spider has every right to live just like you do 
## how is that child going to grow up and look at a  




1509
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:42,160
## different person who's a different size shape and 
## color how is that kid going to look at that person

03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:48,639
## in hatred with violence speciesism by eradicating 
## that we can bring peace to this planet i want  




1511
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:54,161
## to ask you gary but you're concentrating 
## on the moral argument might be that the  




1512
03:10:54,960 --> 03:11:03,520
## health or medical argument in not eating meat 
## may be more effective or the ecological argument  




1513
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:09,520
## of the meat industry spoiling this planet 
## might be more effective but you make it a  




1514
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:17,520
## point to concentrate on the moral argument almost 
## solely why because we claim to be moral beings  




1515
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:21,600
## we claim to know right from wrong we 
## claim to be compassionate and as long  




1516
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:27,200
## as humans make these claims i'm going to be in 
## everyone's face and say you can't do it halfway  




1517
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:33,439
## you can't pick and choose who to be kind to and 
## when to be kind you're kind across the board or  




1518
03:11:33,439 --> 03:11:40,319
## you're not and i'm confused as to why we always 
## have to go back to the table of justice and beg  




1519
03:11:40,319 --> 03:11:47,200
## the majority of people to stop harming and killing 
## somebody else we do this over and over again can  




1520
03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:52,479
## we just cut to the chase and say that everyone 
## on this planet deserves fair and equal treatment  




1521
03:11:53,359 --> 03:11:58,319
## people who eat meat cheese milk and eggs are on 
## the wrong side of justice people who don't support  




1522
03:11:58,319 --> 03:12:04,559
## animal rights will not win this battle injustice 
## cannot live forever it never it lasts a long time  




1523
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:10,081
## unfortunately for the victims but injustice 
## cannot live forever but if someone were to  




1524
03:12:10,720 --> 03:12:20,720
## to to convince you that the ecological argument or 
## the health the medical argument may be much more  




1525
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:27,600
## effective why don't use it because the issue is 
## going to be ethics to me health issues are selfish  




1526
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:32,399
## reasons i'm trying to make people unselfish the 
## reason why we're so mean animals because we think

## people be altruistic as a boy back in michigan 
## in the states of a nice jewish family right  




1529
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:51,439
## was it something that could have told me 
## that uh as a grown-up you'll be doing the  




1530
03:12:51,439 --> 03:12:55,599
## things that you do not a chance not a chance 
## there's no this is what's so bizarre about this

## surprise yeah i i always liked to buck 
## the system i was always kind of a rebel i  




1533
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:13,680
## didn't like rules especially when the rules were 
## silly or unjust or they didn't make any sense so

## years you have to make sure you do this amount 
## of math this amount of english well i despise

## i took extra english classes i'm a speaker i was  




1539
03:13:40,399 --> 03:13:46,239
## always fascinated with words so two weeks before

## here only i can get away with something like that  




1544

## so and then eventually you find yourself 
## in jail as well yeah well you know after  




1545
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:16,000
## when i first found out about the animal issues i 
## of course looked up other revolutions in history  




1546
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:20,960
## i saw what gandhi did that he was going to jail 
## and getting arrested i saw martin luther king and  




1547
03:14:20,960 --> 03:14:26,479
## rosa parks and cesar chavez they were all getting 
## arrested for their cause doing civil disobedience  




1548
03:14:26,479 --> 03:14:32,080
## so i thought that was the path uh to help animals 
## become liberated so that's what i went out and did  




1549
03:14:32,080 --> 03:14:38,800
## too did you did you freeze some animals i freed 
## 1542 mink from an animal concentration camp

03:14:45,279 --> 03:14:50,719
## badly for me that night 540 mink did escape and 
## they were never going to be tortured again they  




1552
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:56,800
## may have their necks broken by the way manually 
## on a fur farm uh i was apprehended that evening it  




1553
