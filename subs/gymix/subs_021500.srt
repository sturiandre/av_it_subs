1057
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:06,800
## because you engage in carnivorous bestiality 
## on a daily basis sometimes multiple times a day  




1058
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:10,560
## you eat things that come out of the hen's 
## ass and shove things into a turkey's ass  




1059
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:16,640
## you eat breast legs and thighs and then you pay 
## somebody else to sexually molest a cow and squeeze  




1060
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:23,120
## her nipples for you so you can steal her milk man 
## you guys are obsessed with bird asses and cow tits




1061
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:33,040
## enough already seriously is it 
## possible to step into the 21st century  




1062
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:41,200
## and stop mimicking the behavior of cavemen 
## and cave women you got a choice today  




1063
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:47,040
## when you leave this room you can choose 
## to never intentionally harm another animal  




1064
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:52,000
## for breakfast lunch or dinner ever again 
## these animals have never violated you or  




1065
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,200
## taken advantage of you in any way the 
## least you can do is return the favor  




1066
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:06,560
## or stay radically cruel keep the status quo as 
## is make sure animals have their babies stolen  




1067
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:11,760
## from them make sure their horns are cut off 
## be sliced off testicles ripped out make sure  




1068
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:18,560
## they're raped make sure they never experience 
## one drop of human kindness and make sure there's  




1069
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:26,800
## a knife in their throat every second of every 
## minute of every hour of every day for eternity  




1070
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:34,000
## i hope you make the right choice isn't it rough 
## enough being an animal on this planet with us  




1071
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:43,280
## around as we claim everything for us the 
## land is ours we pollute the air the water  




1072
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:49,120
## destroy the forest and the mountains do we have to 
## maximize the cruelty that they already endure by  




1073
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:54,399
## eating them on top of it all you want to talk 
## about pouring salt into somebody else's wombs




1074
02:16:56,559 --> 02:17:06,080
## 98 and i want to leave you with this stat 98 of 
## animals who are abused and killed on this planet  




1075
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:15,599
## are abused and killed by the meat dairy and egg 
## industries the least we can do is minimize the  




1076
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:22,318
## cruelty by living a vegan lifestyle i want to 
## thank you guys for listening i do appreciate  




1077
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:28,879
## the open minds that's out there today hello 
## everyone my name is kate timko before gary  




1078
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:33,519
## begins with the formal presentation this evening 
## i'd like everyone to stop and think for a moment  




1079
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:39,439
## stop and think about the certain rights and 
## freedoms that many human beings have just received  




1080
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:45,439
## over the last 150 years now these are rights and 
## freedoms that many of us take for granted we don't  




1081
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:51,200
## think about every single day for instance 150 
## years ago and in the grand scheme of things really  




1082
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:59,519
## that's just a blip but 150 years ago in america 
## we still had slavery 100 years ago not one child  




1083
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:07,120
## in the united states had any rights whatsoever 85 
## years ago women could not vote and 40 years ago  




1084
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:13,280
## only 40 years ago segregation was still thriving 
## in america meaning that black people could not  




1085
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:19,679
## drink from the same water fountain as white people 
## only 40 years ago now one of the most amazing  




1086
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:26,478
## traits that human beings possess is our short-term 
## selective memory process now we do love to believe  




1087
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:32,159
## we've been good decent compassionate to each 
## other for a very very long time but decency and  




1088
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:37,439
## compassion are pretty much brand new concepts 
## when it comes to the treatment of most human  




1089
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:45,359
## beings now it is our hope that in the next 150 
## years we will all continue to evolve with decency  




1090
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:51,759
## continue to evolve with compassion and extend it 
## to the entire animal kingdom humans and animals  




1091
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:58,639
## together the entire animal kingdom so if anyone 
## came in today thinking animal rights is radical  




1092
02:18:58,639 --> 02:19:05,519
## or extreme outrageous or maybe even silly please 
## stop and think about those certain rights and  




1093
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:12,799
## freedoms that human beings have just received over 
## the last 150 years and then one could logically  




1094
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:18,639
## conclude that animals will be the next group of 
## disenfranchised beings to obtain their freedom  




1095
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:24,478
## so i guess it's safe to say that this room is full 
## of people who eat meat i'm sure most people here  




1096
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:29,918
## own shoes or belts or jackets made from the 
## skin of cows kate and i used to wear leather  




1097
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:37,120
## shoes belts and jackets too and i ate meat for 25 
## years k-8 meat 4 23 before i talk about veganism  




1098
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:42,478
## in detail all the ethical and health reasons 
## for living a vegan lifestyle and discuss what  




1099
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:48,079
## it's like to be an animal in the food industry i 
## want to talk about the blinders that everyone has  




1100
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:53,519
## on blinders that kate and i used to have 
## on too blinders that absolutely destroy  




1101
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:59,281
## compassion blinders that make people unconcerned 
## about cruelty and killing and blinders that  




1102
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:06,240
## give some people the audacity to laugh and make 
## jokes about the suffering of animals now those
