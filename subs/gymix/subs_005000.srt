401
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,480
## just like most of you would do because once again 
## anyone can choose to be peaceful or violent either  




402
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:19,040
## way it is a choice and i have many other videos in 
## that section also showing carnivores refusing to  




403
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,600
## kill their supposed prey and for the people out 
## there right now who might be thinking yeah gary  




404
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,680
## but if animals want to be treated equally to us 
## and treated fairly then the animals who eat other  




405
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,760
## animals need to be arrested and charged with 
## murder you are missing my point completely but  




406
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,600
## i support that honestly i do as long as all 
## the humans who eat animals turn themselves  




407
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,520
## in to face the same consequences be careful 
## about throwing stones in your glass house  




408
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,240
## because if we really want to arrest animals 
## and charge them with crimes they actually need  




409
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,240
## equal rights they currently have no standing in 
## court meaning we can't even bring them to trial  




410
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,040
## but as soon as animals receive the same rights of 
## life and liberty as us meaning they can no longer  




411
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,120
## be the victims of slavery and murder i'll call the 
## cops and the next cat i see for killing a squirrel  




412
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,800
## until then i am placing the moral mirror in 
## front of your faces it's time for you to walk  




413
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,440
## the compassion and talk that you're always 
## talking about you can't just pray for peace  




414
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,600
## sing songs about love and happiness and 
## togetherness turn on the five o'clock  




415
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:40,720
## news hear about a tragedy and go oh that's so sad 
## and then go out and do violent things like those  




416
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:47,600
## damn hippies did in woodstock bunch of hippie 
## crits did you know that they consumed over one  




417
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,520
## million hot dogs during that four-day festival 
## and i bet you thought the hippies were on my  




418
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:01,120
## side peace and love and flower power my ass peace 
## begins at the dinner table with a vegan meal but  




419
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,920
## instead we always want to get together and see how 
## many dead animals and nasty animal products we can  




420
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,040
## eat at once bacon and eggs and cheese and steak 
## and chicken and cheese and lobster six cheese  




421
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,400
## pizzas with every pig product imaginable triple 
## cheese bacon burgers with a side of asparagus  




422
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,720
## wrapped in bacon we actually praise people 
## in our society for killing animals you've  




423
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,720
## seen all the tv shows glorifying fish killers 
## duck killers chefs who cook nothing but meat  




424
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:36,160
## guys who'll eat anything from testicles to brains 
## schmucks who win hot dog eating contests it's now  




425
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,040
## time to watch a five and a half minute video 
## about where breakfast lunch and dinner come from  




426
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,320
## and before i press play i need to 
## be pretty clear about something  




427
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:53,600
## there is no such thing as humane slaughter or 
## humane slavery meaning that humane meat cheese  




428
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,840
## milk eggs and honey do not exist if i told 
## you that there was a nice outfit in thailand  




429
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,360
## where they humanely raped kids for the child porn 
## industry you know they use condoms and lubricants  




430
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:15,680
## that are playing a big backyard every day 
## for six glorious hours in between the rapes  




431
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:25,200
## would you support it i didn't think so is that 
## because rape is always evil no matter how it's  




432
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:34,640
## being done so stop focusing on how animals are 
## being harmed and violated and start opposing  




433
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:41,120
## all the different ways of enslaving abusing 
## and killing innocent beings this means that  




434
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:48,800
## buying local organic cage-free free-range 
## grass-fed kosher all antibiotic-free hormone-free  




435
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:57,200
## is just as evil and no different than buying 
## conventional from afar from a factory farm  




436
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,120
## and if you feel the need to turn away or close 
## your eyes during this video you might want to  




437
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:09,840
## ask yourself a question if it's not good enough 
## for my eyes then why is it good enough for my




438
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:23,840
## stomach




439
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,840
## foreign




440
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:51,840
## um
