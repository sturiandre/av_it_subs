1453
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:06,000
## their victims they are really doesn't matter what 
## i think to you to me yes but most importantly to  




1454
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:12,319
## the victims the victims don't see the people that 
## killed jews any different than the people who kill  




1455
03:05:12,319 --> 03:05:19,519
## cows and people that were furs should be raped 
## i wish listen i certainly don't wish that they  




1456
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:25,279
## hit the lottery i don't wish that bags of money 
## fall from the sky and boxes of lollipops land  




1457
03:05:25,279 --> 03:05:30,399
## in their laps i wish evil things happen to evil 
## people but i want to be clear about this i hope  




1458
03:05:30,399 --> 03:05:36,879
## rapists get raped i hope child molesters get raped 
## i hope all the evil people in the world have evil  




1459
03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:41,600
## done upon them so maybe they can for the first 
## time in their lives understand what it means  




1460
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:47,440
## to be treated like nothing i don't understand 
## why my wishes are worse than people's actions  




1461
03:05:48,479 --> 03:05:52,719
## people that eat meat dairy and eggs 
## people that wear fur coats that support  




1462
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:57,359
## vivisection that do vivisection i tell you why 
## it's important i tell you why it's important  




1463
03:05:57,359 --> 03:06:03,759
## because maybe someone hears you right now and 
## will take action which will be which will be  




1464
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:09,120
## violent which will be a murder a killing okay 
## two things do you know when i made that statement  




1465
03:06:10,479 --> 03:06:17,519
## 1997. okay it's been 16 years and not one 
## person has raped a woman in a fur coat because i  




1466
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:24,399
## wished it all right okay so let's not get into 
## people taking my words that literally it was my  




1467
03:06:24,399 --> 03:06:30,000
## wish it was my fantasy and by the way i also 
## wrote three other lines about how rapists  




1468
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:35,760
## should be used in experiments how rapists should 
## be tortured and killed how come people don't talk  




1469
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:41,040
## about those things that i say nobody disagrees 
## with my position on violence they just only  




1470
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:47,519
## disagree with who i propose to be violent 
## for see everybody thinks it's okay to kill  




1471
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:53,359
## nazis on behalf of jews okay to kill a white slave 
## owner on behalf of a black slave but nobody thinks  




1472
03:06:53,359 --> 03:07:00,080
## it's okay to kill a chicken murderer on behalf 
## of a chicken so that's the issue at hand is why  




1473
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:06,399
## do we devalue the life of a chicken and why do 
## we value human life so because nature is full of  




1474
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:12,240
## species killing other species it's also full 
## of species not killing other species 75 of the  




1475
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:17,120
## animals on this planet are herbivores of course 
## but why do we try to justify human behavior based  




1476
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:21,840
## on lion behavior or shark behavior it's also 
## unfair because nobody else wants to do anything  




1477
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:26,160
## else that lions do you notice that convenient 
## argument we just want to do what the lions do  




1478
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:31,840
## when they eat antelope no the argument is it 
## might be quite natural to kill animals maybe you  




1479
03:07:31,840 --> 03:07:38,400
## should do it in the most humane way possible 
## and exaggerate what like a humane holocaust  




1480
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:43,920
## we can't throw this word humane out there when 
## we're talking about rape torture and murder  




1481
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:49,279
## you can't put the word humane next to it doesn't 
## work like that that's not how the world works  




1482
03:07:49,279 --> 03:07:56,399
## like if let's let's take for example some farmer 
## far away maybe far away in time in the past  




1483
03:07:56,399 --> 03:08:04,319
## grows an animal and the animal has a 
## wonderful life grazing and enjoying itself  




1484
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:10,319
## and when the time crime comes he kills it the 
## animal in in the in a you know you know in a  




1485
03:08:10,319 --> 03:08:16,160
## nice way is the nicest possible this is not rape 
## this is not holocaust this is the way of life  




1486
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:24,160
## okay so if i go and meet a woman at a bar i 
## buy her some drinks i bring her some flowers  




1487
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:30,559
## i take her back and put on some soft music 
## some teddy pendergrass and we dance and we  




1488
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:36,000
## look in each other's eyes and i slippery 
## date rape drug and rape her is that humane  




1489
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:44,080
## why not she didn't feel a thing see because the 
## act of rape is evil okay the act of murder is evil  




1490
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:48,720
## you can't do it in a nice way okay we have 
## to stop thinking that there's a nice we  




1491
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:55,840
## in fact you know what the nice way to kill is 
## not to kill that's a nice way is it working  




1492
03:08:55,840 --> 03:09:01,920
## do you think do you think that the world is 
## progressing um in the direction you wanted to pre  




1493
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:08,240
## to progress in a pace that's efficient 
## not quickly enough for the victims but  




1494
03:09:08,880 --> 03:09:17,200
## sadly as you know change is slow it took 400 years 
## to convince white people in america not to own  




1495
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:23,760
## blacks you can see why this is taking so long we 
## can't even treat each other kindly you can see  




1496
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:30,319
## why we have a difficult time treating chickens and 
## pigs and cows and mice and insects with kindness  




1497
03:09:30,319 --> 03:09:36,319
## but as i bring this up i want to let people know 
## that the the path to peace is through veganism  




1498
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:43,359
## it is by we could we can find peace on this 
## planet by eradicating speciesism because  




1499
03:09:43,359 --> 03:09:49,439
## this is the first form of hatred humans are taught 
## racism sexism anti-semitism heterosexism these are  




1500
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:55,839
## branches of hatred the root is speciesism because 
## that's the first form of hatred humans are taught  




1501
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:59,520
## when you're a kid growing up you're taught 
## hey be nice to the dog be nice to the cat  




1502
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:04,160
## but that cow that chicken yeah he doesn't count 
## just kill them screw them uh be nice to the horse
