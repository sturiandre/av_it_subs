320
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,840
## ain't no fun when the rabbits got a gun and they 
## saved their baby how about that he was still alive




321
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,320
## looks like the buffaloes the zebra and the 
## hippo didn't get that memo about the way  




322
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:28,800
## meat eaters want the world to be good afternoon 
## everybody my name is gary yourofsky i'm a vegan  




323
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,720
## animal liberation activist been vegan more 
## than 18 years which means i do not eat or wear  




324
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:46,080
## anything that once had a face a mother or a bowel 
## movement no meat cheese milk eggs and honey no fur  




325
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:55,120
## leather wool silk or down and no animal byproducts 
## whatsoever instead i've decided to eat normal food  




326
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,040
## real food that wasn't tortured and killed 
## and covered in blood and guts and pests like  




327
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,520
## fruits and vegetables nuts and seeds grains 
## and lentils i wear clothing made of hemp  




328
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:17,120
## bamboo cotton and a host of other materials 
## that were not ripped off of somebody else's body  




329
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,120
## now i chose this lifestyle back in 1996. 
## when i finally understood that speciesism  




330
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,120
## believing that the human species can do 
## whatever it wants to any animal species  




331
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:40,320
## was the essence of bigotry and hatred more victims 
## are left in this path than all other forms of  




332
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:49,680
## discrimination combined worldwide we are torturing 
## and killing 150 billion animals every year  




333
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,920
## to satisfy our meat dairy and egg addictions 
## and billions more for clothing and entertainment  




334
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,680
## so when you're not vegan you end up paying 
## somebody to kill thousands of animals just  




335
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,320
## for you throughout your lifetime that's not 
## only violent commodification and selfishness  




336
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,880
## it's pure hypocrisy because what if you 
## were the victim remember you have to examine  




337
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,840
## all issues of injustice from the victim's point 
## of view and what if somebody commodified your body  




338
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,280
## labeled you stupid and dirty mocked your 
## entire existence and said that your life  




339
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,680
## didn't matter at all i suppose you'd want 
## the world to change its evil ways immediately  




340
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,400
## and hope that somebody like me would stand 
## up speak out and defend your right to be free  




341
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,000
## don't you think the animals we torture and kill 
## feel the same exact way and speaking of stupid  




342
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,320
## and dirty have you been to an airport lane seen 
## a public restroom the hudson river following the  




343
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:09,440
## rise of stds ever notice that the majority of 
## people have never once started out on the right  




344
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:19,120
## side of justice and we have the audacity to say 
## that animals are stupid and dirty so how come  




345
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,960
## small groups of people always have to convince 
## the masses why it's wrong to enslave discriminate  




346
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,160
## or kill innocent beings the answer 
## is quite simple technologically  




347
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:45,120
## we are brilliant ethically we're on par with 
## parasites we are a sick twisted mistake of  




348
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,520
## a species so the way we treat the animals and 
## each other doesn't even shock me anymore what's  




349
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,080
## shocking is that the masses are always shocked 
## when they're accused of acting inappropriately  




350
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,080
## it took 400 years to convince white people in 
## america not to own black people and another  




351
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,160
## 100 years on top of that to end segregation and 
## if somebody wants to hang out after class and  




352
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,120
## explain to me why those abolitions didn't 
## take two seconds i'd love to hear about it  




353
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,280
## any injustice on that scale can only happen 
## if the general population supports it or  




354
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,760
## turns a blind eye to it so the key players 
## in the exploitation government religion  




355
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:43,520
## media corporations they become experts at lying 
## and using propaganda and deceit to trick people  




356
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:52,320
## into accepting the abuse the dairy industry for 
## example loves to tell you about happy cows but  




357
00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:00,320
## what they don't tell you is that all these happy 
## cows get raped every year artificially impregnated
