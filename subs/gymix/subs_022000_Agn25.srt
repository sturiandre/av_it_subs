1103
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:11,519
## blinders were not attached to us or anyone 
## else with malice a forethought necessarily  




1104
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:16,720
## but the truth has been hidden from us 
## nonetheless today's speech will give you  




1105
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:23,600
## the opportunity to write many horrible wrongs if 
## you give us 60 minutes of an open mind tonight  




1106
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,000
## we promise you will walk out of this 
## room more ethical than when you came in  




1107
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:34,319
## so instead of trying to find an excuse tonight 
## not to be vegan we're sincerely asking that you  




1108
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:40,639
## find an excuse tonight to be vegan and i just 
## want to clarify the word vegan for everybody  




1109
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:45,760
## vegans and vegetarians don't consume 
## the meat of any land or marine animal  




1110
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:51,200
## but the difference between vegans and vegetarians 
## is that vegans don't consume milk cheese eggs or  




1111
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:57,120
## any animal product whatsoever and keep this 
## in mind as well the best thing about veganism  




1112
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:03,840
## there are millions of christian jewish muslim 
## buddhist black white asian latino male female  




1113
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:10,479
## pro-life pro-choice pro-gun and anti-gun vegans 
## and millions of people who label themselves  




1114
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:17,519
## republicans or democrats or independents are 
## vegan too matthew scully the senior speechwriter  




1115
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:24,399
## for george w bush recently wrote a book called 
## dominion it's a right-wing faith-based christian  




1116
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:29,439
## conservative views supporting veganism 
## and animal rights because your ethnicity  




1117
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,080
## religious affiliation and political party have 
## no bearing no bearing on eating a veggie burger  




1118
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:42,399
## tonight instead of a hamburger you see if you 
## honestly put yourself in the position of an animal  




1119
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:48,719
## who is enslaved in the food industry confined to 
## an artificial world denied your freedom denied the  




1120
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:54,240
## right to live a long healthy life denied sunlight 
## most of the time and then imagine yourself being  




1121
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:59,200
## stuffed into a transport truck to be shipped to 
## your death hung upside down by your legs at the  




1122
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:04,080
## slaughterhouse so someone could cut your throat 
## dismember your body so someone else could cook  




1123
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:11,600
## it and eat it if you honestly put yourself in 
## that animal's position there is no way you can  




1124
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:16,560
## justify the things that we do to animals and 
## walk away from today's speech saying that you  




1125
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:22,241
## don't care the ethical compass that most people 
## use to gauge right from wrong is the golden rule  




1126
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:28,000
## treat others like you would want to be treated do 
## unto others as you would have done unto you since  




1127
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:33,600
## no one in this room wants to be treated like a 
## cow a pig or a chicken there's really no reason to  




1128
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:39,600
## search for an excuse tonight not to be vegan now 
## we're going to show a graphic four minute video  




1129
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:45,600
## about where food comes from at the slaughterhouse 
## and the video you're going to see is the harsh  




1130
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:51,280
## truth but i want everyone to remember throughout 
## what german philosopher arthur schopenhauer once  




1131
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:56,639
## said about truth schopenhauer stated that 
## all truth everything that we hold to be true  




1132
02:22:56,640 --> 02:23:05,520
## has to pass through three stages now first it is 
## ridiculed second it is violently opposed and third  




1133
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:11,520
## it is finally accepted as being self-evident so 
## which stage of truth do you find yourself in now  




1134
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:17,840
## and which stage of truth might you be in if 
## you give us an open mind an hour from now




1135
02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:45,840
## uh




1136
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:13,840
## so




1137
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:41,840
## um
