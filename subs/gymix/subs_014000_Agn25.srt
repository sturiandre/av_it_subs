01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,600
## just might suffer more than any enslaved animal 
## on this planet chino california for instance  




799
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:17,200
## they had the largest concentration of dairy farms 
## on this planet more than 350 000 cows lived there  




800
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,920
## kept alive for three to seven years machines 
## hooked up to their udders for several hours  




801
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,280
## a day sucking milk out with hormones and 
## antibiotics forced into their bodies to make  




802
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:33,040
## them produce tremendous amounts of milk until they 
## can no longer produce tremendous amounts of milk  




803
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:39,920
## you know the dairy industry has done a masterful 
## job at convincing everyone that cows naturally  




804
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,240
## give milk i hope you don't believe that cows 
## are like any other female animal they can only  




805
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:53,040
## give milk during and after pregnancy so once a 
## year dairy cows are artificially impregnated to  




806
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:58,800
## keep the milk flow going and within two days of 
## giving birth within two days their babies are  




807
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,160
## taken away from them which is outright cruelty in 
## and of itself their babies are stolen from them  




808
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:10,560
## at birth most of the male babies sent off the 
## veal farms putting crates so tiny they're never  




809
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,360
## allowed to stand up ropes and chains put around 
## their necks to completely immobilize them and  




810
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:22,400
## prevent any muscle development whatsoever which 
## is why veal flesh is tender no muscle development  




811
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:28,480
## as for the females most of the females kept on 
## the dairy farm enslaved like their mothers they  




812
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:34,960
## will be turned into dairy cows as well the rest 
## of the females and some of the males sold to the  




813
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:45,840
## beef industry where they will be killed at nine 
## months of age thank you very much for listening




814
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:52,720
## okay i'm going to take you guys on a 
## journey today and like all journeys in  




815
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:57,040
## life there's going to be ups and downs highs 
## and lows you're going to like certain parts  




816
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:02,560
## and dislike other parts in other words you 
## will love me and hate me today all at once  




817
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:08,640
## but if you listen with an open mind i promise at 
## the end of the speech the love will outweigh the  




818
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:15,760
## hate the first 30 minutes will be very intense i'm 
## going to make you feel angry frustrated and guilty  




819
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,880
## fortunately the last 15 minutes will be like 
## a comedy roast so we're gonna laugh and giggle  




820
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,520
## you guys are getting roasted by the way so i'm 
## gonna speak for around 45 minutes and then we'll  




821
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:31,840
## do a q a session after so hold your questions 
## until the end right now i want you to think  




822
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:38,080
## about how you would feel if the moment you were 
## born someone else had already planned the day  




823
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:47,360
## of your execution that's what it's like to be a 
## cow a pig a chicken or a turkey on this planet  




824
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:54,480
## they're not born free they're born to be murdered 
## even though freedom is supposed to be a birthright  




825
01:42:55,040 --> 01:43:01,600
## a god-given right i mean no god would be 
## a slave master a torturer and a killer  




826
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:09,840
## of his animals his babies if he was then 
## he wouldn't be god he'd be the devil  




827
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:17,760
## if that statement shocks you or brings up feelings 
## of animosity towards me the problem isn't with me  




828
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:25,440
## and what i've just said the problem is that humans 
## have victimized animals to such a degree that they  




829
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:32,080
## aren't even considered victims they aren't even 
## considered at all they're nothing they don't count  




830
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:39,440
## they don't matter they're commodities like tv sets 
## and cell phones we've actually turned animals into  




831
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:48,720
## inanimate objects sandwiches and shoes it 
## is the greatest magic trick ever performed  




832
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:56,480
## the animation switch and besides the money 
## made from selling their flesh and skin and  




833
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:03,360
## the things that come out of their bodies there's 
## not even decent value on them as inanimate objects  




834
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:12,800
## the american flag for example which is nothing 
## but a piece of fabric the bible which is nothing  




835
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:19,840
## but a book comprised of ink and paper stir 
## up more emotions than the murder of animals  




836
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:27,120
## if there were a barbecue near campus today and 
## people were cooking up steaks and hamburgers man  




837
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:33,920
## there'd be a party people would actually celebrate 
## the cow who was killed the person who killed the  




838
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:42,320
## cow and the chef that seasoned her dead body but 
## if someone poured gasoline on the flag or a bible  




839
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:50,560
## struck a match and set it on fire lord have 
## mercy there'd be an angry mob ready to kill  




840
01:44:50,560 --> 01:45:00,400
## somebody these lifeless inanimate objects the flag 
## in the bible are more sacred than animals living
