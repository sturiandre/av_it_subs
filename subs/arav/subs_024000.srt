1605
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:10,319
## that's that's me as well you know that's kind of 
## i faced that personally uh we do have a question  




1606
02:40:10,319 --> 02:40:14,880
## though now from um i'm not even going to try and 
## pronounce your name i'm sorry i should oh should  




1607
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:20,319
## knights disrespectful mr jackal let's say um do 
## you think donating money to animal sanctuaries  




1608
02:40:20,319 --> 02:40:24,639
## is worth the money oftentimes the same people who 
## say outreach doesn't work advocate for donating  




1609
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:31,680
## to sanctuaries or fundraise themselves well of 
## course it's worth the money i think we need we  




1610
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:37,760
## need people to donate to animal sanctuaries and 
## also donate to organizations like av so that we  




1611
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:43,760
## can keep doing what we're doing i think it's all 
## needed so once we have these animals who are being  




1612
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:49,840
## rescued obviously they're gonna need a home so 
## that's where the animal center is coming and  




1613
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:55,360
## they can't just operate without the money so yeah 
## i think that's obvious that it's worth the money  




1614
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:02,000
## yeah i think maybe they're also alluding to 
## the idea that a lot of these same individuals  




1615
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:08,560
## will say don't donate to ed or james or av 
## or or whatever donate to a sanctuary because  




1616
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:13,600
## it's better and you kind of give the impression 
## that it's one or the other you know that there's  




1617
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:19,680
## people that that's it you can only choose one 
## and you know one should get all the money um  




1618
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:28,640
## which which is nonsense obviously yeah um 
## all right this is from michael paul and assal  




1619
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,960
## you're still young do you think we'll be living 
## in a majority vegan world in your lifetime




1620
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:40,399
## i want to say yes so badly 
## i just really don't know  




1621
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:44,879
## doesn't feel like in the next 50 years 
## or so we're going to achieve that




1622
02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:55,120
## to be realistic standing sure i 
## think for my side of this i think um  




1623
02:41:55,120 --> 02:42:02,080
## i agree but i also see it as positive that we i 
## feel like we lay the foundations for the future  




1624
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:07,439
## generations that will achieve this so although 
## we won't see it be realistic we're not going  




1625
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:11,839
## to see it but we can do a lot of good 
## work to help the future people to see it  




1626
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:19,600
## yeah it's like two-pack said you know we may not 
## be the ones to see that but we will be the ones to  




1627
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:25,840
## spark the minds of those who will create that 
## world and if we don't create it ourselves but  




1628
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:32,959
## um i think it's more important to just 
## be focused on spending our lifetime  




1629
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:42,000
## on fighting for a vegan world rather than being 
## attached to it coming to fruition in our lifetime  




1630
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:46,800
## not that this question suggests that it's just 
## wondering whether we think it will happen or not  




1631
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,920
## i guess i just stopped thinking about it and 
## caring i guess i just i'm focused on what  




1632
02:42:51,920 --> 02:43:04,240
## i can do day to day and uh in our lifetime that's 
## all that we can focus on cool agreed um a super  




1633
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:08,399
## question this is a super chat by the way if anyone 
## was wondering what that looks like it looks like  




1634
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:12,799
## this so you can put a price on it and it means 
## that will uh you'll pay for it it means you'll  




1635
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:17,760
## get your question answered so any updates on 
## future campaigns for next year once covid is gone




1636
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:27,679
## we're gonna get back to our world tour that 
## we were doing i just um just started that tour  




1637
02:43:28,399 --> 02:43:36,559
## did two cities ended it as a result covered 
## so that tour will continue and then we will  




1638
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:41,439
## pardon me we will do two weeks of truth 
## which we're really looking forward to doing  




1639
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:48,880
## we're going to do one damn week and 
## we're going to do what was the other one  




1640
02:43:49,439 --> 02:43:57,279
## uh we're going to do the av academy 
## it's going to be a boot camp um and




1641
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:06,160
## yeah that's it yeah we will do those things 
## once this whole thing's over awesome cool  




1642
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:10,080
## um i've got another question here 
## but i'll just give you a heads up  




1643
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:15,920
## it's a it's a it's a one of those another kind 
## of accusational question all right so just gotta  




1644
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:19,040
## give you a heads up on it it's one that i 
## forgot to cover with you actually i didn't  




1645
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,439
## have time to cover it with you but i think i 
## was gonna cover it i guess we can cover it now  




1646
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:29,760
## it's the about the rumor that uh about the 
## whole creation of av um this rumor has been  




1647
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:34,800
## around for a long time as far as i know i think 
## i've seen you deal with it once before on another  




1648
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:40,000
## live or something but uh yeah if you could 
## respond to this is it true that another activist  




1649
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:45,680
## from melbourne created the idea i've never 
## this is actually new i've never had this one  




1650
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:53,840
## okay okay ask paul to be a violent volunteer 
## for them yeah one have you well there's a  




1651
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:59,840
