## so there you go what's that yeah this is 
## a completely new thing i've never heard of  




1653
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:17,279
## what a wise imagination um yeah that's 
## it's interesting because uh nah this is  




1654
02:45:17,279 --> 02:45:22,000
## i've never had this one before i'm wondering 
## where this has come from and i'm wondering




1655
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:30,560
## yeah i don't what's the what's the correct 
## political was the political correct term for  




1656
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:36,800
## chinese whispers these days oh god i don't even 
## know i i would just say that but yeah you're  




1657
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:42,640
## right i think people would get would get upset 
## about that actually no um i don't know okay well  




1658
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,800
## that's what this is i'm trying 
## to use the correct term but uh  




1659
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:53,440
## trying not to crucify me guys uh yeah so you know 
## i don't really know you know i don't really know  




1660
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:58,559
## what this is but we know about 
## the original accusation that came  




1661
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:07,120
## from individuals plural in melbourne and 
## uh and that's all documented actually it  




1662
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:13,519
## came out with the whole liberation is inclusive 
## truth of cube uh video that was made about us  




1663
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:23,120
## um they jumped on that bandwagon and contribute 
## contributed to the document that was linked in the  




1664
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:29,120
## caption of that video wherever it's shared you'll 
## see the link and wherever you see that link you'll  




1665
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:33,760
## see the document and in that document you'll 
## see these individuals who came out initially  




1666
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:42,479
## and made this accusation that they created av with 
## us and that we stole it from them now this story  




1667
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:51,840
## that we're being asked of here is is is is 
## claiming that it was uh we were volunteering




1668
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:06,960
## according to this person just to close this 
## off they say it's they're saying this is a  




1669
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:11,520
## direct claim from the person who claims 
## to have had this conversation with you  




1670
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:16,880
## so it's it's uh it seems like it's um i 
## don't know if you don't if you don't know  




1671
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:23,200
## this and it's it's it's you know it seems 
## made up i guess yeah it's like when someone  




1672
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:30,160
## becomes famous many people start coming out and 
## claiming that that person is their cousin right  




1673
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:35,679
## uh and yet that's what this it's kind of like 
## the same thing here people are claiming that  




1674
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,680
## they created a v but there's no basis for 
## any of this we've heard i've heard a couple  




1675
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:47,840
## of different uh people trying to claim this over 
## the years but um these people aren't doing much  




1676
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:56,880
## yeah so that's what they claim to to activism is 
## but i uh i i feel for these people if they really  




1677
02:47:56,880 --> 02:48:03,520
## want to tear like they want to try to steal that 
## from us all the hard work we've put in and all the  




1678
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:09,920
## commitment we've given to this organization 
## if they want to try to steal that from us  




1679
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:13,600
## it says something about what 
## they're suffering from internally  




1680
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:17,040
## like i'm sorry that they thought 
## they need to take from us  




1681
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:22,560
## in that scenario because it means that they 
## must be hurting somewhere somewhere else  




1682
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:27,121
## and not feeling adequate for themselves and i i 
## really mean it that i feel bad for these people




1683
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:34,160
## fair enough um funny question okay it's kind 
## of funny um are you friends with joey carver  




1684
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:40,880
## strong again nope no yeah i thought that might be 
## the case i genuinely like i didn't say this in my  




1685
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:44,960
## video actually but um when i made the video 
## about this but i on a personal note you don't  




1686
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:51,040
## have to respond to this but i i do hope i do hold 
## some hope that that can be fixed between you guys  




1687
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:54,720
## that you can come to some kind of i don't know 
## i hope that you can be friends again because it  




1688
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:59,600
## was you know you had a good thing going it was 
## supporting each other it was good it's a shame  




1689
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:04,800
## to see it all go to [ __ ] but he did what 
## he did and what happened happened you know  




1690
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:11,680
## yeah look i forgive him for making a 
## stupid mistake he's human humans make  




1691
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:18,960
## stupid mistakes but for as long as he won't 
## acknowledge his mistake there's no room for  




1692
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:22,640
## i don't i can't be friends with people who 
## lack accountability it's just not a part of  




1693
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:26,320
## my quality that i hold myself to 
## and what i expect from friends  




1694
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:33,679
## yeah that's understandable it's understandable 
## but i can't yeah as many most people i can't  




1695
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:38,319
## help hoping that it can be worked out but it's 
## yes it's kind of in his court isn't that the  




1696
02:49:38,319 --> 02:49:44,080
## balls in his court on this um someone's asking 
## a question that it's it's an obvious question  




1697
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:49,279
## uh but i'm gonna put it up anyway because 
## it's a yeah you can easily just answer it um  




1698
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:53,120
## it's on the transgender topic again they're 
## saying you said everyone should be respected
