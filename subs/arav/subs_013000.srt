896
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,240
## you operate with these two individuals let's say 
## being around how are you going to determine who  




897
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:13,360
## who should be respected and and you know should 
## be dealt with in a very in a respectful way  




898
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,200
## and who should actually be told no don't 
## bring your ideologies here leave it at home  




899
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:27,360
## well everyone everyone everyone needs to be 
## respected okay everyone including yeah that's  




900
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:36,560
## the answer everyone needs to be respected so i 
## mean uh everyone is entitled to their opinions  




901
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:44,720
## but no one is entitled to use their to weaponize 
## their opinions against others and that's my  




902
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:52,080
## most accurate answer to that okay sure everyone 
## is respected for their opinions and their right to  




903
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,320
## have an opinion no one has a right to weaponize 
## their opinion against others in any way and so




904
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,360
## that's it i mean you know where do we draw 
## the line with human stuff as well because  




905
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,680
## we allow people who are disabled to come 
## to our cubes and rock a wheelchair in the  




906
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:16,880
## cube we've had so many people in wheelchairs 
## in our cubes around the world we don't say




907
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,720
## we don't you know we welcome these people i don't 
## know why i'm using that as a point i guess it's  




908
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:31,600
## just of course we welcome different uh struggles 
## and we accommodate different struggles within nav  




909
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:37,280
## but only as far as getting the job done is 
## required because we're there for the animals and  




910
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,840
## that just needs to be respected 
## also everyone needs to be respected  




911
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,400
## for the mission when we're at the cube but 
## i think we should move on now to the next  




912
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,120
## subject all right all right okay can 
## i close off of the bottom line and  




913
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,160
## bottom line yes or no question and then 
## we'll move on is that all right with you  




914
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,720
## but it's bottom line yes or no then so what 
## i'm understanding is that someone comes to the  




915
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:07,680
## cube they request to be called a certain thing 
## and people in the cubes people the organizers  




916
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:14,400
## are requested to respect that and if they get it 
## wrong by accident no worries don't do it again  




917
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,960
## if you get it wrong on purpose you're being 
## disrespectful and you'll be you'll be if it  




918
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,480
## comes up you will be told either told off or or i 
## don't know warned and saying that that's bullying  




919
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,640
## am i right is that correct is that if i understood 
## this correctly or is there something i've missed




920
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:43,840
## um sorry i sorry i just kind of zoned out for a 
## bit so you said right somebody got it wrong by  




921
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:50,960
## accident no worries obviously what are we gonna 
## do um and then if they did it on purpose they're  




922
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,920
## gonna get kicked out is that always not kicked 
## out whatever it may be they'd be either warned  




923
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,840
## or if it's been multiple times let's say you 
## would you you would take a further action if  




924
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,160
## it's if it's becoming a habit you know if it's 
## something they've done more than once for example  




925
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:11,680
## yeah um yeah basically but like what i was saying 
## earlier if somebody feels that strongly about  




926
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:17,040
## it that they're not willing to because they 
## feel like they're accepting that ideology  




927
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:22,320
## by referring to um say you showed up at a 
## cube and you want to be referred to as she  




928
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:30,240
## and like i just can't accept that then in that 
## case they could refer to you with your name  




929
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,160
## and if they're not willing to do that then yes 
## that would be an issue because then that person  




930
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:41,680
## buying this thing on not wanting to refer to 
## you as whatever then that that person is taking  




931
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:46,320
## away from the event in the queue because they're 
## good yeah they're making good about anything else  




932
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:53,040
## yeah they make yeah okay but i think that yeah 
## that seems reasonable to me but i'm i'm i guess  




933
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,880
## it's not good enough for everyone for a lot of 
## people but i i feel like it's reasonable i just  




934
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,240
## wanted to clarify it before we moved on though 
## yeah when we move on i just want to say one more  




935
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:08,800
## time like this has literally never happened in 
## our personal experience has never happened and i  




936
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:16,320
## haven't heard of a specific um event where this 
## was the issue and this this was brought up and  




937
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:23,120
## somebody you know had an issue with referring to 
## someone else with their preferred name or pronouns  




938
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:29,920
## i just want to say how uncommon this is but yeah 
## i guess it's just about future proofing because  




939
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,200
## this is the world we're in um now you know uh 
## it's it's i don't think it's a bad world that  




940
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:40,720
## we're in i think it's good i think uh that's why 
## i wanted to really get into it because i i am 100  




941
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,640
## certain that as as we go into the future this 
## is going to become more and more and more common  




942
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:49,680
## and not just in av in other organizations 
## like you know jobs like people working in  




943
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,960
## offices and stuff like that this is going to 
## start becoming more and more common because  




944
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:59,360
## people you know in general people don't like 
## change um in general uh so you're gonna have to i  




945
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,720
## think we i feel we hope we all have to expect that 
## we're gonna be some people out there who are gonna
