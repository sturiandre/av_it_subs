351
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,080
## know manager leader organizer of that group and 
## if you don't like it then that's absolutely fine  




352
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,040
## you either continue volunteering or you create 
## your own thing and do it your way it's basically  




353
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,240
## is that am i is that what you're saying basically 
## what yeah because like of course we always welcome  




354
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,440
## feedback but welcoming feedback doesn't mean we're 
## going to take it on board we're going to discuss  




355
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,320
## it between us too and then the team that we have 
## and then we might take it on board or we may not  




356
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
## but to expect that every single feedback is just 
## going to be accepted and we're going to implement  




357
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,560
## that idea whatever it might be i think that's very 
## unrealistic yeah it will be very chaotic so yes if  




358
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,240
## somebody doesn't like the fact that you know their 
## feedback wasn't accepted then i think if they feel  




359
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,760
## like they're not aligned with the organization 
## then they should just do their own thing i mean  




360
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,000
## that just makes sense to me it's just very common 
## yeah and you know i think you clarified but just  




361
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,160
## to make sure just to make sure that no one is 
## confused by what we're saying here we're not  




362
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,800
## saying you know if you if you have any input you 
## know you have any feedback you have any criticism  




363
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,040
## as a represent as a representative of 
## ab whether you're an organizer volunteer




364
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
## we're not saying that we're just going to 
## say [ __ ] you and go do your own thing  




365
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:39,600
## that's not how we operate we and like to think 
## that we've only ever enacted ideas that have come  




366
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:47,120
## from either my brain or a cell's brain is insane 
## we've always taken on feedback from others  




367
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,480
## and taken it into account and i think the 
## last thing i want people to consider here is  




368
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,240
## where would av be today like really think 
## about where a baby would be today if we  




369
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:08,560
## weren't operating the way that we are if we 
## ran a system where we had like a board of um




370
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,960
## you know board of directors 
## where we only had a vote  




371
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,440
## into what was and we only had two votes of many  




372
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:30,720
## into what was being decided on i mean i think it's 
## i i think it's clear that av wouldn't be clear  




373
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:39,920
## about the message and i don't think that we would 
## be where we are today that leads on to another  




374
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,480
## point quite nicely actually because i think what 
## i feel like you're hinting at here is that that  




375
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
## if you didn't maintain control you feel 
## that av would go down the same road as  




376
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
## pretty much every other ar organization 
## has gone down where they are bringing in  




377
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,600
## uh human issues um human rights issues and 
## basically kind of i guess i guess if you could put  




378
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,720
## in a way that they're moving with the times rather 
## than staying true to what they started for if  




379
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,360
## that makes sense um and some people would say that 
## that is a positive thing you know to move with the  




380
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:17,280
## times because let's be honest the you know the the 
## times are very much changing and you know a lot of  




381
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,240
## human rights issues have very much been thrown to 
## the front and that's not necessarily a bad thing  




382
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,120
## um but you could argue that ar organizations 
## also taking those fights on board is some  




383
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,560
## some and i guess you would argue that is a bad 
## thing and that brings me to another question that  




384
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,400
## has been asked or let's say a topic that has been 
## brought up uh the topic of anti-intersectionality  




385
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,680
## and uh and you know what this means with with av 
## what intersect or not intersectionality i don't  




386
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,560
## think that's even the correct thing to talk to 
## to say because i don't intersectionality itself  




387
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,480
## i'm sure we all if there's anybody in this in 
## this chat or even you guys that say disagrees  




388
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,040
## with the concept of it i would just say you're 
## disagreeing with facts right if the fact is that  




389
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,800
## intersexuality as it was originally coined 
## it's it's factual it's like you know someone  




390
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,880
## who's female or black will experience the world 
## differently to someone who's male and white or  




391
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,480
## someone who's female and white or someone who's 
## you know transgender and black or transgender  




392
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,240
## everyone experiences the world differently and has 
## different challenges right that's what it means  




393
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,680
## that's literally what it means not what vegans 
## have made it that's [ __ ] so we all will agree  




394
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,080
## that that's what it means i'm sure and i you 
## know i guess no one really would would say it  




395
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,760
## would argue against that it's just logic it's just 
## factual but let's say uh the they call themselves  




396
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,320
## consistent anti-oppression crowd let's say and and 
## this is something that you have get like more than  




397
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,800
## once you've stood out stood up against and you've 
## said said some things about you know the animals  




398
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,360
## first um approach non-humans first approach um 
## and this has been widely criticized and a lot  




399
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,440
## of people have even you know people make videos 
## about this they are constantly attacking you guys  




400
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,040
## for this they are people um saying they won't they 
## won't go to av events because of this um so yeah
