00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:11,680
## it's a bandwagon for us to disagree with 
## you on using that comparison but but it's uh




102
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:21,680
## that's just a taste in music which i guess is 
## i guess it's a taste in activism i guess you  




103
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,640
## could that's the comparison you're making kind 
## of yeah kind of but i think with nickelback  




104
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
## um well anyway i don't want 
## to get into the comparison




105
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
## maybe it's for the best yeah um but i'm going 
## to give an example actually because i i did have  




106
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
## a plan set up for this stream but you know 
## what i feel like this is relevant right now  




107
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
## so i want to tell the viewers a quick story 
## here about something that happened um i put  




108
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
## these messages out didn't i put these posts 
## out on my instagram asking people give me some  




109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
## give me some questions give me some topics i put 
## it on facebook and by the way one of those posts  




110
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,960
## is blown up with a load of nonsense but anyway 
## that's another topic but some people responded  




111
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,360
## to me saying you know certain things and i want 
## to just bring up one of these responses that i had  




112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,560
## um from somebody on my instagram who who had a 
## story to tell and i want to just kind of link  




113
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,520
## it in with what we just said about it's cool to 
## hate av it's cool to kind of just you know find  




114
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,840
## something wrong and just almost even sometimes uh 
## [ __ ] as well so i'm going to show you something  




115
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,400
## that happened and this is real by the way i'm 
## not this is not designed this wasn't planned this  




116
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,680
## is something that genuinely happened and i've 
## got the evidence because i can show you my um  




117
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,840
## i can show you this the literal inbox from my 
## instagram and you'll see why this is relevant  




118
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,720
## in a moment so i'm going to show the screen so you 
## can see it all right so here's my stories right i  




119
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,560
## don't know if you can can you see that right now 
## no how do i change those hold up i need to um  




120
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,800
## add the different screen i've never added 
## like a like uh this kind of screen i'm trying  




121
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:07,440
## to get the uh preview screen up okay hold 
## second all right open up um where are we




122
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,200
## all right here we go so here's a story that uh i 
## put my story out that night saying like tell me  




123
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
## any topics you think should be discussed somebody 
## responded saying this why do you treat your  




124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,760
## organizers like disposable garbage right now like 
## on the surface you're thinking wow okay that's  




125
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,000
## that's pretty intense right what's going 
## on here so i responded to this person  




126
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,240
## how do i have to switch this every time yeah i do 
## so i responded to this person very simply saying




127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,920
## basically i responded saying okay give us give 
## me some information i need to ask this question  




128
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,920
## properly so this is the response i got when the 
## allegations of fraud came up i commented on one of  




129
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,600
## paul's comments stating something along the lines 
## of it being standard practice to ask for financial  




130
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,080
## information paul was very aggressive in his 
## responses even abusive i told him i was one of the  




131
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,320
## organizers and he told me to [ __ ] off and leave 
## so i stood down these are not isolated incidents  




132
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,920
## unfortunately his temper gets in the way and 
## he burns his people his own people good luck so  




133
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
## i i'm not saying that i don't believe that person 
## and at the time i said you know okay i believe you  




134
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
## but i need some evidence right i need something 
## to show here do you have a screenshot do you have  




135
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,000
## something to show me that i can show to them and 
## uh you know i'm happy to discuss it and this is  




136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,280
## the answer that i got i don't he cleans up his 
## message straight away i know you believe me but  




137
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,000
## understand you need for proof you could perhaps 
## pose the question more broadly is this is behavior  




138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,960
## as a pattern of his and so will be hard to deny 
## sorry i can't help you any further david so  




139
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,280
## it's pretty damning right this is pretty damning 
## and at the time i gotta admit that i was a little  




140
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,880
## bit like swayed because look i know paul and 
## i know you both paul and the style and i know  




141
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,680
## that sometimes you know i lose my [ __ ] too i 
## say things that i later come to regret i've told  




142
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,800
## people to [ __ ] off i've told i told someone to 
## [ __ ] off live in a live stream by by accident  




143
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,680
## i thought they were saying something that they 
## weren't i told them to [ __ ] off and then they  




144
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,320
## were like why what's wrong i only said this i 
## got completely mixed up so it's not it's not  




145
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,440
## like you know we're infallible we make mistakes 
## but anyway i brought this up with you guys right  




146
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,240
## and um luckily paul actually had the screenshots 
## of this interaction now i'm going to show you what  




147
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,600
## the actual interaction was actually hold up i 
## just realized there's one little thing i need  




148
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,320
## to blur out but you're not going to believe you're 
## not going to believe what the actual interaction  




149
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,840
## went like um on the surface of this it looks 
## it obviously looks like it's a done deal right  




150
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,360
## and i'm going to explain why this is relevant 
## after i've shown you if you're wondering  




151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
## watching this if you're wondering what how is this 
## relevant you'll see in a moment and i'd just like  




152
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,240
## to add that this is how people commonly talk about 
## they be when they say negative things about us  




153
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,680
## yeah definitely definitely this is this is 
## this is why i'm bringing it up it's it is  




154
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,840
## absolutely like this and i want to get 
## into this as a topic as well it's not just  




155
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,400
## a thing but hey look so here we go this is the 
## actual interaction so this is the individual
