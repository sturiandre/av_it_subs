1552
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:10,080
## video there's no way to determine this we i i'm 
## only uh making an educated guess here okay so  




1553
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:14,960
## even after hours and hours of research being put 
## into that video that was her conclusion but how  




1554
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:22,319
## are these individuals coming to this conclusion 
## when is this where is this data even being logged  




1555
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:27,520
## how all those marine animals that are slaughtered 
## in the fish industry are they being logged  




1556
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:34,399
## who's who's noting how many animals are being 
## murdered like it's all an assumption and um i  




1557
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:40,080
## wouldn't trust any any piece of information 
## coming from animal agriculture of course or  




1558
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:45,519
## any study that's funded by animal agriculture of 
## course if it says something to the effect that  




1559
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:49,360
## their products are on the rise and they're doing 
## really well and all this i wouldn't trust that  




1560
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:55,359
## and especially since we know actually that the 
## dairy industry is on its way out there's many  




1561
02:35:55,359 --> 02:36:01,839
## indicators of that so it depends on what you're 
## looking at and i need more data and more evidence  




1562
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:08,880
## to even entertain the notion that uh that it's 
## going in the opposite direction in terms of the  




1563
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:14,720
## numbers however in terms of public perception and 
## the way that animal rights is perceived publicly  




1564
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:19,680
## now animal rights has been pushed even further 
## back than it was last year i do agree with that  




1565
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:28,240
## yeah no totally i agree all right that brings us 
## to the end of my topics um and now if you've if  




1566
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:32,399
## you've i guess it's late for you guys actually 
## but if you do have another like let's say let's  




1567
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:36,639
## limit it to maybe like i don't know would you 
## agree for another 20 minutes is that okay 30  




1568
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:42,000
## minutes or is that too much for you guys right 
## now 20 minutes sounds good all right i can see  




1569
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:49,680
## yeah i'm waking up and you're and you're going 
## to bed so this is kind of like yeah yeah how  




1570
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:55,120
## late is it sorry what time 40. all right okay 
## cool yeah we can start to wrap up then so  




1571
02:36:55,120 --> 02:37:00,880
## um guys you got to put some questions in um i 
## didn't see you putting any questions in so far  




1572
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:04,240
## i'm not going to go back through all the way back 
## to the beginning because i know some of you aren't  




1573
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:08,160
## even here anymore so if you've got questions 
## now's the time and if you really really want your  




1574
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:12,479
## question to be asked like right now and you want 
## it to make sure you fit it in 20 minutes in the  




1575
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:18,240
## next 20 minutes then you can uh do a super chat 
## and that will 100 be asked as long as it's not  




1576
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:25,200
## something shitty um to be to put it bluntly uh but 
## yeah we're open to questions now for the next like  




1577
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,319
## 20 minutes or so but after that 
## i'm gonna let them go to bed so  




1578
02:37:30,319 --> 02:37:36,719
## i'm gonna run to the toilet sure man go go 
## no worries no worries and whilst whilst i'm  




1579
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:40,399
## waiting for that yeah i just want to say i do 
## really appreciate you both coming on here i know  




1580
02:37:40,399 --> 02:37:45,920
## it's it's mentally exhausting to go through these 
## things um especially considering that some of them  




1581
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:51,439
## are really ugly accusations right um i've i've 
## the reason one of the main reasons i wanted to do  




1582
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:56,080
## it as well is because i feel like i can empathize 
## with this because i've also been on the receiving  




1583
02:37:56,080 --> 02:38:01,680
## end of equally ugly accusations so i know i know 
## how it feels when you read that like we all we all  




1584
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:07,120
## pretend like yeah well whatever you know whatever 
## but like really it does it does get you right when  




1585
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:12,080
## you read something so horrible and someone's 
## saying it about you i know how it feels so i'm  




1586
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:17,200
## happy we could get through this and and you know 
## i hope a few people have had uh i hope it's given  




1587
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:22,880
## a few people something to think about at least so 
## they don't go and repeat this nonsense uh over and  




1588
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:29,760
## over again because it doesn't it doesn't feel good 
## to read it does it you know yeah i just hope that  




1589
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:36,240
## what people can take from this maybe is that they 
## start thinking a bit more critically and if they  




1590
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:43,920
## hear something they ask for evidence they ask for 
## proof you know they look into it before deciding  




1591
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:50,000
## that somebody is a racist sexist etc because 
## these are horrible things that you can say and  




1592
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:58,160
## yeah i just it's sad that people can just use this 
## term so loosely now and they don't realize how  




1593
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:05,600
## insulting and destructive that is and how much it 
## actually takes away from the real victims of these  




1594
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:16,479
## um depression so yeah no for sure um yeah i'm 
## gonna be honest with you it doesn't look like  




1595
02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:20,160
## there's any questions coming in i guess i guess 
## we kind of answered so much i guess they don't  




1596
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:24,160
## have any anything else that's not being answered 
## to be honest i thought about this earlier in that  




1597
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:28,000
## we've gone through so many topics that 
## maybe there aren't going to be questions  




1598
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,439
## because there's like 60 people watching right 
## now and so far there's no questions so if that's  




1599
02:39:33,439 --> 02:39:36,799
## the case we can we can wrap up there's a lot 
## of statements though i can put some of those  




1600
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:40,400
## on the screen you know just like for the 
## last like maybe like 10 minutes or so just  




1601
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,200
## being king saying here they don't have evidence 
## for their claims and when they do it's hilarious  




1602
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:51,680
## i i mean this is how it seems to be right that 
## they there's no evidence or there is evidence but  




1603
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:56,560
## it's not evidence like it's something they have 
## made a i don't know they've made it some kind of  




1604
02:39:56,560 --> 02:40:04,400
## assumption from or they've twisted right yeah this 
## seems to be happening most of the time really yeah
