1293
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:08,480
## again if they feel that they they say need to but 
## let's be honest we don't need that burger right um  




1294
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:13,120
## so they say they would do it again and some 
## people are saying because of that the av  




1295
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:17,200
## is not abolitionist and that's why they don't 
## want to work with av anymore how do you what  




1296
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:25,280
## do you think of that well i just think that 
## to be consistent um exactly what you said if  




1297
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:32,480
## we are consuming products that at one time in the 
## past they were tested or an ingredient was tested  




1298
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:39,840
## we also use many products that um again were 
## either tested or they are produced by a company  




1299
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:46,800
## that is not vegan and you know like we can just 
## keep going down this rabbit hole but ultimately to  




1300
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:52,400
## be consistent with the values that we have i think 
## it's okay to say that if you're vegan and you  




1301
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:56,480
## eat the impossible burger you're not suddenly not 
## vegan that's literally what i was saying i wasn't  




1302
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:03,760
## promoting it necessarily but i was saying um the 
## impossible burger is as vegan as the beyond burger  




1303
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,240
## because one of the things that i don't think i 
## mentioned in that video and i think it's something  




1304
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:14,800
## that i actually learned after doing that video was 
## that when they were working on the beyond burger  




1305
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:20,640
## they were buying burgers made of cow flesh 
## and they were testing them or they were maybe  




1306
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:26,640
## just having a tasting session or whatever 
## to get the texture or the flavors right so  




1307
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:33,120
## i don't see any difference between the two um 
## in one scenario cows are being murdered for the  




1308
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:38,480
## burgers and in the other scenario mice are being 
## murdered because they're being tested on so i just  




1309
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:43,920
## see them exactly the same they're just different 
## animals that are being used in the process but  




1310
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:50,240
## i just think to be consistent you either have to 
## say i don't use anything that was ever tested or  




1311
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:56,640
## is ever coming from a company that uses animals or 
## uses animal testing or you're just going to have  




1312
02:11:56,640 --> 02:12:02,880
## to accept that we do live in a non-vegan world and 
## as much as possible yes sure you can avoid it but  




1313
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:07,520
## i just don't see the difference between like i 
## said that product and other products that we're  




1314
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:13,120
## using um like the beyond virgo which nobody 
## has ever taken an issue with i haven't seen it  




1315
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:21,280
## and if i can just add to this argument that 
## we as an organization have made essentially  




1316
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:30,640
## regarding this topic uh the only arguments i've 
## ever heard from those who are trying to damn us  




1317
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,320
## by uh saying that we're not like we're not we're 
## not abolitionists because we hold this position  




1318
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:45,760
## the only argument i see coming from these 
## people is an argument for how impossible  




1319
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:52,240
## foods as a company is not vegan to which we 
## totally agree with the company is not vegan  




1320
02:12:53,360 --> 02:13:02,000
## the product itself however is vegan and that's why 
## ourselves made the distinction between this and  




1321
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:08,160
## any other company that sells a vegan product 
## a non-vegan company selling a vegan product  




1322
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:16,080
## has always been a product that vegans consume and 
## are still considered to be vegan when they consume  




1323
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:21,760
## it uh and we don't you know when you said we 
## don't we don't need the impossible burger that the  




1324
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:28,160
## same could be said for every other product that 
## exists on the shelf so where do you draw the line  




1325
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:35,680
## and how do we make veganism practical for people 
## by saying you can only support vegan companies  




1326
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:42,960
## if you're only supporting vegan companies in 
## this modern world we live in i don't think  




1327
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:49,200
## veganism is possible that's it's actually i think 
## an irresponsible message if we care about animal  




1328
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:56,080
## liberation yeah so there's two points i'd like 
## to push on a little bit further with this um  




1329
02:13:56,080 --> 02:14:01,520
## one of them being that what do you think about 
## this is this these are this is internal okay  




1330
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:05,520
## i'm with you and i think that i just want 
## to put this point away actually that this  




1331
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,520
## will not in my opinion what we are discussing 
## here is the message we put out to the public  




1332
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:14,240
## because i don't believe that that's it's it's 
## going to be in any way uh beneficial for us to  




1333
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:21,040
## slam the impossible burger to the non-vegan public 
## right that doesn't make any sense um whatever they  




1334
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:27,760
## tested it on animals yeah it's [ __ ] but um 
## it's making tracks with non-vegans and it's it's  




1335
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:32,240
## i don't know it's it's i feel like it's more 
## of an internal thing that that we discuss in  




1336
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:37,360
## this like as part of the animal rights movement 
## should this be an accepted thing like into the  




1337
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:40,720
## movement or into veganism should this burger 
## be accepted should these products be accepted  




1338
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:46,640
## i feel like that's what we're discussing more 
## than a public statement um and that being said  




1339
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:49,680
## so a company like i mean that's where i 
## stand on it anyway that's why i don't really  




1340
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,560
## i don't want to get into like should we 
## talk about it you know pushing it to the  




1341
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:57,280
## public or not i don't really think advertising 
## vegan consumerism is i don't really agree with  




1342
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:00,640
## that anyway i'm not posting about subways 
## vegan option or mcdonald's vegan options
