1343
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:08,320
## has never done yeah no i know that's yeah i think 
## we're on the same page with that that's why i  




1344
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:12,400
## just i think we can just kind of go on because 
## i don't i don't like that i see others doing it  




1345
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:17,680
## i'm like okay cool but it doesn't sit right for 
## me to promote these massive monster companies uh  




1346
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:23,600
## it doesn't feel right um but but if people do it 
## that's their call right it's not for me my point  




1347
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:28,480
## i was going to make though with this is that so 
## for example quorn is a massive company in the uk  




1348
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:33,360
## i don't know if they're in australia too but they 
## uh they're one of the oh cool so like the og like  




1349
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:38,560
## um fake meat mock meat companies and they they 
## have this thing called microprotein and that was  




1350
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:44,160
## tested on animals when they first released it but 
## the pushback was so intense and from vegetarians  




1351
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:50,320
## that they had to like reconvene and they released 
## a statement where basically the uh i think it was  




1352
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:56,720
## the ceo i can't remember it's on their website 
## right now um he basically says that he he regrets  




1353
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:01,200
## it that he wishes that he did it differently 
## or she i can't remember if it's a guy or a girl  




1354
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:05,520
## and they said they will never test on animals ever 
## again this company will never do it ever again  




1355
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:12,400
## and we totally listen to your feedback and it's 
## done um versus unfortunately the impossible burger  




1356
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:15,840
## impossible foods and i think beyond 
## foods as well i think beyond me also  




1357
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,520
## say this they're saying the opposite like 
## they're saying they're going to continue to test  




1358
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:24,000
## for me and for many i think that's where they 
## draw the line and say wait a minute okay testing  




1359
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,800
## once is one thing testing once and saying yeah we 
## see you're pissed off and we know it's wrong but  




1360
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,280
## we're going to do it again if we if we want to 
## they they draw a distinction between these two  




1361
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,040
## companies and one being like okay we'll support 
## this one and the other one they say no we're not  




1362
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,359
## going to support them because they're pro with 
## a section you know where do you stand on on that  




1363
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:48,478
## comparison that logic doesn't work that logic does 
## not work because corn is still selling products  




1364
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:54,958
## with cheese and egg in it um or at least egg yeah 
## they have a vegetarian range and a vegan brain  




1365
02:16:54,959 --> 02:17:00,559
## so yeah okay they're against animal testing 
## they're still not a vegan company however yeah in  




1366
02:17:00,559 --> 02:17:06,719
## exactly the same way that impossible foods is not 
## a vegan company so sure but comparison then yeah  




1367
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:13,840
## yeah well no it's just people are getting 
## angry about what they choose to be angry about  




1368
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:19,040
## yeah i think it's about being consistent 
## that's a great point because they're not  




1369
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:24,160
## a vegan company and the whole range is not 
## vegan so why are we only taking issue with  




1370
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,840
## animal testing and not what happens to 
## the animals in the dairy egg industry  




1371
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,439
## sure sure it's about that's my bad that's a 
## bad comparison with corn um i guess what i  




1372
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:37,919
## was trying to get at is is uh we've supported 
## a company that is going to say that they're  




1373
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:43,439
## going to continue to test on animals but is 
## producing um plant-based burgers like is is  




1374
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:47,919
## there no is is there no ethical consideration to 
## be hard here i guess is what i'm trying to say  




1375
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:57,040
## of course come on man of course there it is of 
## course of course we need to ask impossible foods  




1376
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:04,639
## to cut the [ __ ] and stop testing on animals and 
## to be vegan but the point here is that expecting  




1377
02:18:04,639 --> 02:18:12,559
## them to be vegan before you buy their product 
## which is vegan stand alone in and of itself is  




1378
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:19,280
## just a ridiculous uh standard to apply if you're 
## going to do it you have to be consistent and that  




1379
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:24,160
## would make it impractical to be impractical to 
## be negan it would make it impossible to be vegan  




1380
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:29,919
## and i don't mean to use that pun 
## but we're in an impossible situation  




1381
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:37,120
## sure okay okay um yeah i think that's all i 
## wanted to ask about that i don't think there's  




1382
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:41,680
## anything else i can go through do you have 
## anything to close on that with it being mainly  




1383
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:45,200
## the questions targeted at you is there anything 
## else you'd like to say to people who are still  




1384
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:51,200
## like dubious about this or unsure about this i 
## think that's it just the last point that you said  




1385
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:59,760
## about um you know how they've they've basically 
## said they will test in the future and then coin  




1386
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:05,840
## saying they will never do it again i just think i 
## personally on a personal level i don't take that  




1387
02:19:06,799 --> 02:19:11,919
## seriously anyway just because the ceo came out and 
## said something i don't take it either way i don't  




1388
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:18,000
## take it as seriously as others actually forget 
## because i just think okay i'll just wait and see  




1389
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:24,719
## in future if impossible keeps doing it 
## then i will not be supporting it anymore or  




1390
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:30,240
## um at the same time i don't trust that 
## company that says we will never do it again  




1391
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:34,799
## i just don't trust people like that because they 
## might do it and at the same time they are abusing  




1392
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:40,479
## other animals anyway so that's why like somebody 
## just making a statement on their website is not  




1393
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:46,959
## i don't take it that seriously no one no one 
## is protesting magnums the vegan magnums the  




1394
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:54,000
## company whether they put out a statement or not 
## uh are saying in their actions that they do not  




1395
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,760
## reject animal abuse that they will continue to 
## condone it and sell products and make money off  




1396
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:04,399
## the backs of animals because just look at the 
## rest of their range same could be said about
