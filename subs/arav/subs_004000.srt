401
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,720
## this is the topic we're going to get into i'll ask 
## you a question someone just asked this question  




402
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,400
## earlier uh why do intersectionals intersectionals 
## not like you that's what someone said so that's  




403
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,840
## an easy question to start with why do these 
## people hate you why are they coming for you  




404
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
## why are they trying to cancel you why are 
## they trying to ruin um your organization




405
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,520
## you want to go only um yeah i i guess 
## yeah like you you already explained that  




406
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:42,480
## it's not that we're anti-intersectional um we 
## just made a decision that av is going to be 100  




407
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,600
## dedicated to the animals non-human animals and 
## there are many reasons why we decided on that  




408
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,720
## but that doesn't mean that we don't think or 
## anyone within the organization not just us too  




409
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:05,040
## doesn't believe that other groups of beings need 
## um voices to speak up for them or we shouldn't be  




410
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,200
## doing activism in different areas so it's again 
## it's just the way that people decide to interpret  




411
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,480
## this like someone decided that because av is 100 
## dedicated to non-human animals that means that  




412
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,600
## we have hatred towards humans or we there's 
## discrimination when it comes to certain groups  




413
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:34,480
## of humans and they're just running with that 
## idea i think it's easy to paint that image of us  




414
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:44,320
## given that we are aware of the fact that we 
## dedicate av 100 to animal rights in light  




415
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:53,520
## of a temp the temperament currently in society is 
## that anyone who does such a thing must also pander  




416
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,480
## to human rights otherwise it's totally out 
## of place so we're completely aware of this  




417
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:06,560
## and we still won't pander so it's easy to 
## paint us like that but we don't care because  




418
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,600
## we want for this to exist in the world we 
## want a movement who is still willing to just  




419
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,880
## do the right thing in the face of what is popular 
## in the moment and you've been also a popular thing  




420
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,920
## that comes up when discussing these things 
## is the the idea of a hierarchy of oppression  




421
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,200
## of which it it appears that you that you guys do 
## um have a hierarchy as in you i've heard at least  




422
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,280
## you paul especially i've heard this but i 
## don't know if i'm sure you've said it as well  




423
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,600
## and this is not an attack it's just you 
## know just quoting um that the animals  




424
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,640
## are by far the most depressed beings on the 
## planet right and some people get upset about  




425
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,320
## that because they say that you're creating a 
## hierarchy of oppression and apparently this is  




426
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,040
## this is uh this is wrong um how do you 
## respond to that um that's disrespectful  




427
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,840
## and it's a spit in the face of every animal 
## that that is subjected to that injustice  




428
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,840
## you know you can you can act like you're 
## offended by these semantics all you want  




429
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,280
## but just remember that while your charade is going 
## on you're spitting in the face of the victims who  




430
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,400
## are involved in the injustice that you're carrying 
## on about and that's my response to that it's just  




431
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,400
## simple that we shouldn't have to explain that 
## we're not saying that humans aren't oppressed




432
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,640
## um yeah like what you said doesn't sound 
## like something that resonates with me  




433
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:59,280
## the hierarchy of depression but it is a fact 
## that the animals well okay so in terms of the  




434
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,320
## number of individual animals who have been 
## tortured and abused and murdered compared to  




435
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,240
## any other injustice that's literally what we're 
## talking about so i don't think it's i don't think  




436
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,000
## it means like if anyone takes that as so you're 
## saying there is a hierarchy of oppression meaning  




437
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:25,680
## this group is more oppressed or we should speak 
## up for them first that's not what we're saying you  




438
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,280
## can't take that from from saying you know animals 
## are the most suppressed meaning they have been  




439
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,960
## um they have been oppressed for the longest and 
## the number of individual victims is higher than  




440
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,480
## any other injustice that's just the fact that's 
## the reality of it and you're right if somebody  




441
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,840
## gets upset because of that then i think they 
## need to just reflect on why that is because  




442
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,320
## i know that there are people out there that were 
## more oppressed than me as as a woman of color  




443
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,040
## and so therefore anyone else in any other 
## group then they should know that there are
