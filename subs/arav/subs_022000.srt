1397
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:10,399
## cliff bars same could be said about literally 
## every other product that we as vegans consume  




1398
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:18,879
## and these companies that they come from are not 
## vegan companies so it's just asinine to expect  




1399
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:25,840
## this uh from impossible like just because you eat 
## their burger it doesn't mean you condone them as a  




1400
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:33,359
## company if that's the case you're condoning every 
## company you ever purchase anything from but you're  




1401
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:39,519
## really just condoning that product you're really 
## just buying a product yeah and then to people  




1402
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:43,200
## that take that position and some people do take 
## that position that by buying the product you're  




1403
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:50,960
## in the company um and um and it's like you said 
## i think it's practically impossible uh to do that  




1404
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:56,000
## but then they would argue that okay but it's not 
## it's practically impossible but then surely that  




1405
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
## that's that's the same as saying it's practically 
## impossible to be vegan but we're just doing  




1406
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,760
## the best we can and we're going to make extra 
## efforts to not buy from companies that we know  




1407
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:08,640
## are are really bad though what do you think 
## that would be an incorrect statement because  




1408
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,680
## that would suggest a different definition 
## of veganism veganism is literally defined by  




1409
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:19,200
## avoiding animal abuse as much as 
## practically possible it's not practical  




1410
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:24,719
## to carry out veganism in the way that 
## it's being suggested in in all this stuff  




1411
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:29,439
## it's just that's not practical we're not 
## even talking about a scenario where you have  




1412
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:34,559
## two options in front of you one from a vegan 
## company and one is an impossible burger and  




1413
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:39,840
## you have no other food options because you're on a 
## desert uh you're on a deserted island or something  




1414
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:45,680
## that's not the scenario we're in here uh because 
## in that scenario obviously the better thing to do  




1415
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:54,080
## would be to choose the product from the vegan 
## company um but it's not as black and white as this  




1416
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:59,760
## okay cool all right we'll close that chat to it 
## we've got just two more topics left and then we'll  




1417
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:04,080
## we'll go to a q a so um i don't know how many 
## people are left from the beginning but there were  




1418
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:08,000
## a lot of questions coming in earlier and i'm not 
## prepared to go through the chat to find them so  




1419
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,479
## if you have questions uh you're gonna have to 
## save them and type them again when we do a quick  




1420
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:17,519
## q a um and as i said if you if you're planning 
## on asking questions keep it sensible or we just  




1421
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:22,720
## won't answer it it's a waste of your time typing 
## it if you're gonna be stupid so just keep that in  




1422
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:28,560
## mind um all right the last last two points then 
## just the first one i want to talk about this it's  




1423
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:32,720
## linked to something we discussed earlier actually 
## about the the people complaining or claiming they  




1424
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:37,840
## weren't getting funded you know like they weren't 
## getting the av fund or whatever and it links into  




1425
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:44,720
## an overall problem of organizers in av getting 
## somehow feeling that they haven't been supported  




1426
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:47,680
## or they feel like they haven't been supported 
## by you or they feel like they've been actually  




1427
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:52,000
## had the opposite like some some ex-organizers 
## go out there and claim that they were actually  




1428
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:57,520
## um i don't know what you would say you guys were 
## rude to them or they were treated badly by av  




1429
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:04,000
## and that's why they left or or um they were booted 
## out or something you know i'm being generic here  




1430
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,479
## in general because every time i've pushed for 
## more information on these claims i've had i've had  




1431
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:12,879
## nothing right so i'm bringing it up as a general 
## topic and you don't need to answer it as if it's  




1432
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:16,720
## like oh this one individual or something because 
## they never provided me any screenshots or anything  




1433
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:22,319
## so i've got nothing to show you um but what why 
## are they doing this why do you think this this is  




1434
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:28,880
## coming up from ex organizers where they're saying 
## i wasn't supported or i was treated badly um where  




1435
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:32,480
## where is that coming from do you think there's any 
## truth to it you know what are your thoughts on it




1436
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:39,760
## no there's no truth to this because we um




1437
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:45,840
## we provide support for every 
## chapter for every organizer equally  




1438
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:53,200
## right we've got all these different things and 
## procedures and systems in place that provide  




1439
02:23:53,200 --> 02:24:00,319
## support from us um to the regional organizers 
## we have a manager that manages the regional  




1440
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:07,679
## organizers and then so all of the organizers have 
## the ability to reach out to us personally in their  




1441
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:14,479
## chat at any moment if they need support if they 
## need advice if they need any kind of help and we  




1442
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:20,879
## always help them and we provide support where 
## we can so to just leave and say that they felt  




1443
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:27,359
## um like they were not supported or they were 
## treated badly it's just yeah we need to see  




1444
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:32,559
## the evidence because it's easy to just make these 
## statements but where is it coming from again it's  




1445
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:38,240
## just because people think okay i'm going to leave 
## av because all these people said paul is racist  




1446
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:44,000
## and this and that and so now i'm going to just 
## jump on the bandwagon and say abe treated me badly  




1447
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:48,560
## that's the only thing i can think 
## of there's no evidence right




1448
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:58,720
## i don't think it's much of a help to anybody 
## for us to comment on this any further than that  




1449
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:05,680
## because there's no specific thing to that we're 
## responding to yeah i'm just trying to get it you
