997
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:16,480
## mission is to tell the truth on behalf of the 
## victims because it's the least that we can do so  




998
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:23,840
## that's what i said and that was that was uh what 
## people have called me racist over so that was like  




999
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:28,960
## i mean it's let's let's let's be like that's not [ 
## __ ] here it's definitely something that would be  




1000
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:35,920
## considered to be like insensitive but but that's 
## not your the goal isn't to be sensitive um a lot  




1001
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,000
## you know it's i don't think being insensitive is 
## necessarily something negative i think sometimes  




1002
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,920
## it needs to be um like that but but how is that 
## translating to racism like if somebody said paul  




1003
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,080
## you're [ __ ] insensitive i i wouldn't i don't 
## think i'd even bring that up because it's like  




1004
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,320
## well yeah that's obvious like you you 
## know your outreach videos tend to be  




1005
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,240
## towards the side of insensitivity and more towards 
## the side of like straight direct like you're going  




1006
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,840
## to get the message whether it pisses you off or 
## not right if you're being sensitive you would  




1007
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,240
## dress it up and be nice but you're not being and 
## that's not something to criticize in my opinion  




1008
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,800
## or it is whatever but that's not the point here 
## the point is racism so how does that translate to  




1009
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:18,320
## racism how do you think someone gets it from 
## that video that that's you somehow you know  




1010
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:24,560
## disrespecting somebody because of their ethnicity 
## just because of her skin color right well no no  




1011
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:30,640
## again no it's not just well it's not just that you 
## are speaking to a white woman would would you get  




1012
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:36,880
## no of course not but it's not just that it's 
## also the fact what people are overlooking here  




1013
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,400
## is if if we are going to entertain the notion 
## that there is insensitivity at play here  




1014
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:47,200
## people are overlooking the fact that she 
## was being incredibly insensitive to the  




1015
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:52,720
## animal victims that she is an oppressor of 
## directly responsible for victimizing herself  




1016
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,840
## and so that's where it started that's where the 
## context of all of this began i was responding  




1017
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:06,720
## to her not by saying [ __ ] black people and [ __ 
## ] black rights but by saying animals are the most  




1018
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:13,280
## oppressed group of beings on the planet if me 
## pointing out a fact is insensitive while she's  




1019
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:21,120
## literally saying [ __ ] the animals and [ __ ] 
## their rights well i guess you need to ask yourself  




1020
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:28,160
## which like what does it take for you to see 
## injustice for what it is especially when it's  




1021
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:34,160
## to the degree that it is he in this case with the 
## animals when they're subjected to the most brutal  




1022
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:40,080
## violence that has ever been carried out on any 
## group of beings ever what does it take for people  




1023
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:49,120
## to to to just literally just acknowledge them and 
## to acknowledge the fact that they are subjected  




1024
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:53,840
## to oppression to the extent that they 
## are subjected to that oppression and for  




1025
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:59,040
## simply just simply for people to simply say 
## that for people to simply speak about that  




1026
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,640
## if that's offensive we have no hope as a species 
## evolving and developing into better ways of  




1027
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:14,080
## of living on this planet and uh with truly 
## addressing injustice and oppression on this  




1028
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,560
## planet it's never going to happen unless we 
## change the way we think around things like this  




1029
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:27,280
## yeah i i i think honestly my opinion on 
## this is like to to label that as racism  




1030
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:35,040
## is is offensive um to it's offensive because 
## it's not even offensive it's it's harmful  




1031
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:42,400
## because it confuses what actual racism is right 
## how how can you call like and this is this  




1032
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,160
## when you really lay it out like this 
## right you've got two people of color  




1033
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:50,000
## you're not white so two people of color 
## having a conversation about the animals  




1034
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,320
## and one of the people says that you know the 
## reality about the animals and somehow that  




1035
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:03,520
## person is racist it's just such a strange thing to 
## call racism over and it completely takes away the  




1036
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,760
## meaning of the word and i've said this before 
## people get really upset about it that the more  




1037
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:14,080
## you use the word racist sexist transphobe the more 
## difficult it becomes to actually identify racists  




1038
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:19,680
## sexists and transphobes and and i think nowadays 
## we're in a position where it's like you said who  




1039
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:26,480
## hasn't been called a racist um or a transphobe or 
## a sexist in 2020 practically anyone who has dared  




1040
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:31,600
## to even question the narrative has been called 
## one of those things it's either you you do what  




1041
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,000
## you're told and you say what you're supposed 
## to say or that's what you get branded with  




1042
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,520
## do you know how harmful that is to the people who 
## actually suffer from sexism racism and transphobia  




1043
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:48,720
## the fact that you know that label is so used so 
## flippantly if you could you could say that for  




1044
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:58,080
## every every other label that is thrown around 
## um to to to to try and cancel others when uh  




1045
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:08,320
## when faceless whether it's the term fascist 
## or or sexist or racist or or whatever it is
