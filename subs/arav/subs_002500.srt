256
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:12,480
## like the major donations coming in um so the 
## biggest part of it would obviously be the payments  




257
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:20,320
## to the team members so including myself paul 
## and um at some point we had just over 30 people  




258
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,720
## working with av so you can imagine how much that 
## would cost roughly and then now we've got i think  




259
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,920
## i don't know actually how many people we've got 
## like around 20 people working with us including  




260
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:42,240
## us too so the the bulk of it is going towards 
## payments so that those people can continue to  




261
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:50,800
## work for av and then the second biggest um thing 
## has always been the av fund which is something  




262
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:58,080
## that we started um and we would dedicate a certain 
## amount of money to go towards chapters that were  




263
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
## um you know active chapters that needed some help 
## getting their equipment so that was always like  




264
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:13,680
## the second um biggest expense for us and then yeah 
## the rest of it is just you know if if people look  




265
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,680
## into what costs are involved in terms of you know 
## all the admin stuff all the programs that you need  




266
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,840
## the software's the subscriptions and then all 
## the big campaigns that we were doing as well so  




267
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:37,040
## okay and with the staff they were 30 were they 
## all full-time 30 staff um no we had so we um  




268
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,480
## we have people that work with us as 
## contractors so av doesn't have like staff  




269
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,880
## necessarily but um everyone's like an independent 
## contractor that comes in and they can do  




270
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:57,360
## um part-time or full-time and um i think i would 
## say maybe it's half-half half of the people that  




271
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,520
## work with us are full-time half are part-time 
## um or just come in as volunteers even sometimes  




272
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,680
## they they do some work casually yeah cool okay 
## cause i'm just trying to like put a number on it  




273
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,440
## i think for anyone who maybe is not following um 
## it's like 30 staff if you had 30 staff that were  




274
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,760
## only working let's say like not full-time hours 
## late so they're working part-time hours right  




275
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,920
## so let's imagine it's 30 staff working 20 
## hours a week so we'll go like we'll go low  




276
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,280
## right we'll pitch low here 30 staff working 
## 20 hours a week and let's imagine that the  




277
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,840
## i'm going to work in yearly salaries here 
## like base yearly salary in euros for example  




278
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,720
## the absolute minimum you could earn a year to 
## survive in a place like i don't know let's pick  




279
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
## a cheap let's baseline everything low let's go low 
## on everything the minimum you could earn in a year  




280
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,400
## in somewhere like spain for example 
## would be like because that's where i know  




281
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,520
## it's like 16 000 euros a year it's the absolute 
## minimum and that's really pushing it like it's  




282
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,720
## really difficult and that would be a full-time 
## salary so that's like that's half that 8 000  




283
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,040
## a year and let's imagine that's 30 staff that's 
## 240 000 euros a year that's a that's pitching low  




284
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,560
## that's if you have no full-time staff that's 
## if all of your staff are only working like  




285
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
## like half-time hours let's imagine right so 
## just to put that into perspective for anyone  




286
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,240
## who's wondering how much that would be so like it 
## could it could be anywhere upwards from 240 000  




287
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,680
## euros a year which would be like i don't know 300 
## 000 us dollars maybe something like that so that  




288
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,440
## is that is a huge chunk yeah and i think uh when 
## i when i first watched the video and i heard that  




289
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,280
## and i worked it out myself at that time and i 
## was like yeah that's actually a chunk of money  




290
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,800
## that i don't think many people understand right 
## um it doesn't it doesn't sound like a lot but  




291
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,720
## when you actually calculated it is quite a lot so 
## um the next thing then you talked about the the av  




292
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,280
## uh fund the for the for the chapters 
## where has it come from then that that  




293
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,360
## does this apparently this is a rumor okay there's 
## no i don't have evidence of this and i'm sure  




294
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,000
## there isn't evidence of this uh maybe there's one 
## or two organizers who have caused this problem  




295
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,720
## but where is it coming from that the chapters are 
## not getting the funding where has that started do  




296
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,120
## you know where that came from or do you know 
## what's going what what is actually behind it  




297
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,800
## like are they getting the funding i'm sorry to ask 
## the question but it came it came up a lot again  




298
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,040
## no i think it's the same thing as everything 
## else like somebody just started this rumor  




299
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,320
## that av keeps the money or specifically paul and 
## assad keep the money to themselves and they don't  




300
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,240
## send any money to the chapters i think it's just 
## again we don't even know where this came from but  




301
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,640
## if people were really interested this is one 
## thing that can be easily tracked we have a  




302
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,640
## full list of everyone who ever received the fund 
## how much they received it what they spent it on  




303
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,960
## and um because everyone who receives the fund they 
## were supposed to send us the invoices so it's like  




304
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:58,960
## we have all the records and um i guess the only 
## thing is that we weren't um doing it in a way  




305
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,480
## that just as as soon as you become an organizer 
## you can receive two thousand dollars or something
