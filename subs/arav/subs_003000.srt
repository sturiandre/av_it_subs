306
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,040
## it was there were certain criterias that you 
## you need to meet as an organizer or as a chapter  




307
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,400
## you need to be active you need to be doing a 
## minimum number of cubes and you need to be you  




308
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:23,440
## know operating for a certain amount of time and 
## then even with that because the money was limited  




309
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,880
## we had to pick chapters so sometimes it 
## was just you know picking this chapter  




310
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,520
## over the other chapter and then next month they 
## would have a higher chance of getting it but  




311
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,120
## um yeah there will be many organizers that would 
## actually be able to come forward and say yeah we  




312
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,000
## received that and this is what we spent it on but 
## i mean our conditions for our criteria for being  




313
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,640
## accepted in in getting the funding was nothing 
## crazy like you had to be on board for six months  




314
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,960
## you know just six months and do one a month 
## i think that's what yeah one cube a month so  




315
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,880
## you had to do a total amount of six cubes before 
## we would we would look at giving you money yeah  




316
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,120
## and yeah you know that's nothing that's nothing 
## too strenuous i think what's happened is  




317
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,600
## a lot of organizers don't really pay attention 
## to what we do they they come on and they just do  




318
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,200
## their own thing in their own cities and they want 
## to be a king or a queen in their own on their own  




319
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,400
## mountains and and literally we've seen so many 
## people come and go who carry this attitude with  




320
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,080
## the navy they just do their own thing in their own 
## city and they aren't a part of what we're doing  




321
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,120
## as a global movement and uh and these 
## people don't really pay attention to  




322
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,120
## the things that we have going on yeah and they 
## don't really know about these uh things to any




323
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,920
## 20 details so they don't apply and then they 
## complain that they never got the money right um  




324
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,000
## how do you how do you think we can handle that i 
## mean this is uh not even an av specific thing but  




325
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,280
## we can we can talk about it for a second that it's 
## something i've also experienced not only in av but  




326
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:24,560
## in save and also in um in even you know grassroots 
## like none like local grassroots organizations  




327
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,960
## local grassroots groups is that there seems to 
## always be some kind of power struggle going on  




328
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,360
## in these groups i don't know if it's only within 
## animal rights or if it's also within i don't know  




329
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,440
## women's rights if it's in black lives matter i 
## don't know if it's in all these groups i i've not  




330
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,840
## been in those groups for enough time to know but 
## in animal rights it seems to be that in every  




331
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,480
## single group there is a power struggle of somebody 
## trying to take over and somebody else who's trying  




332
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,040
## to take over that person and you know somebody 
## who's trying to reject the leader they have or  




333
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,080
## whatever you want to call them leader whatever 
## it is it's it's it seems to be very common like  




334
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,160
## what do you think what's causing that and uh would 
## you have a suggestion on on how to how to fix that




335
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,840
## well you know one of the things 
## i'm really proud of with av  




336
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,120
## is that we really took into account like 
## how we're taken by the public and the fact  




337
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,960
## that we want to be taken seriously and like we 
## want to address that within the public eye and




338
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:29,520
## we don't necessarily expect people to trust our 
## leadership to like trust our decision making  




339
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:38,240
## but i think it's safe to say we've earned a 
## certain level of trust because you know we  




340
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,800
## stick to our ship pretty well and 
## we do what we do pretty well and




341
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:53,120
## and uh those who choose to trust our leadership 
## aren't forced to choose that they choose it  




342
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:02,400
## on their own accord and i guess if you want 
## that entitlement that asylum i have earned to  




343
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:09,360
## run an organization the way that we choose 
## then you should start your own organization  




344
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,120
## sure if you come on to some come on board with 
## someone else you know you choose to volunteer  




345
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:26,000
## or you choose to work for an organization and 
## you're on boarding their ethos and representing  




346
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,880
## what their movement is about you really have no 
## right to say you shouldn't make the decisions




347
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,200
## sure sure so the idea is kind of do you think 
## the baby should be some kind of i don't know  




348
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,120
## um let's say a self-reflection with people who 
## who join groups or who start to work with not  




349
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,960
## just av but with any group really that if 
## you are going to volunteer with a group um  




350
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,200
## i guess you need to learn that maybe your ideas 
## won't always be accepted by the current i don't
